S'[1] Malicious software \xc2\x97 or \xc2\x93malware\xc2\x94 for short \xc2\x97 is a broad class of software built with malicious intent. Over the course of the last few years, malware infection attempts on this forum has become increasingly sophisticated. Below is a summary of infection techniques that I have encountered. With the most sophisticated attacks, common sense and virus scans sometimes are not sufficient to ensure safety."latest wallet"/"custom wallet"/"faster miner"A newbie asks for the latest wallet, or wallet that doesn\'t have any TX fees, or the latest/fastest miner, and the attacker posts a program with malware embedded as a response. This type of attempt usually gets spotted pretty quickly.Copied/new ANNThe attacker creates a new ANN topic and posts a malware link as the download file (or a legit one and changes it to a malware one later).Replacing links in quotesThe attacker quotes a legitimate post containing a download link written by the real developer (usually the OP or a update post) and changes the link within the quote to a malware link.Compromised dev accountThe developer account (usually responsible for making the OP) is compromised and a "mandatory update" is posted. This usually happens with old/abandoned coins so the real developer isn\'t there to notice the rogue update.Packed/FUD executablesIn most of the cases above, the malware has little to no detections on virustotal. This is because any script kiddie can pay $30 and have their malware crypted, rendering them fully undetectable.Good security practices: Don\'t immediately open attachments or click on suspicious looking linksHackers are very good at creating fake emails that look like they are legitimate (usually malware disguised as legitimate files). Either ignore such requests or independently verify that the supposed source did send the email to you. It is also good practice to at least scan the links or files with Virustotal. Anti-Virus/Anti-Malware softwareInstall good anti-virus and anti-malware software that periodically searches for and removes threats. Make sure to keep the software updated at all times and set a scan schedule.Spam FiltersThe forum database was compromised in 2015 which resulted in the emails associated with the accounts being dumped. You are likely already receiving some spam emails due to this. Your email provider my have decent spam filters that will block out some spam. Be careful with everythingAlways be careful with what kind of files you download and run, or what kind of drives you plug into your machine. Both may contain self-executing and undetectable malware.Use common senseNobody is going to give you some *get-rich* Bitcoin mining software, nor is somebody going to sell you any kind of legitimately acquired goods at unreasonably low prices. Do not download and run software from unknown/random users on a machine that you actively use. Even running it inside a VM may not be safe enough.Untrusted WebsitesDon\xc2\x92t visit untrusted websites and take everything you read with a small grain of salt. Hackers tend to create fake websites and pop-ups with enticing messages that are intended to lure you in and download malware. There have been a lot of phishing attacks such as: Phishing ADs on Google, fake Bitcoin wallets on iOS and Google Play stores, etc.Sources:[1] Beware of Increasingly Sophisticated Malware Infection Attempts'

S'I am looking to help move BTC forward into our economy more and would like to get some suggestions on how we can get more retailers to accept BTC as a payment.\xc2\xa0 The best part about accepting BTC is that they do not have any threat of charge-back from the customer.\xc2\xa0 I am just looking for some more input before I start approaching some of these local retailers.'
p1
aS'In my experience, if your going to go one by one and try to introduce them to BTCitcoin and explain how it works in order for them to accept payments of BTC , it would be really a lengthy process and you\'ll stop doing it before you start so the best suggestion I could make is either by making a mini seminar wherein you invite them altogether and talk about it and even show some of the YouTube videos that well known speakers of community are in and they cover almost everything... And in cases of online local businesses, you could try to send them a support ticket regarding the matter and I\'ve had luck that they answered, "were already reviewing BTCitcoin payments and will consider it for the future" .'
p2
aS'You could also make flyers with info on it linking them to a website that has info about bitcoinYou could hand them out personally and talk to them, give them a short explantion as to why you support bitcoin'
p3
aS'If the business is sending money to other country.Than I think is good to tell them that Bitcoin is a solution because is faster and cheaper.'
p4
aS'i would do it simple, tell them the advantages of bitcoin, the fact about very low or zero fee, and the fact that is less trouble some than fiatyou can also add that the payment and confirmation can be instant, if they ask about it, just need to work with an off chain system liek bitpay'
p5
aS"I don't think that we should do anything actually! When you try and force something up on somebody, that doesn't work well as imagined! We need to keep improving on our technology and on our applications and all these people, merchants, etc, will come towards us eventually when they see and hear about all the benefits that Bitcoin can give to them!\xc2\xa0 "
p6
aS'I am sorry I disagree. Doing nothing will allow this to grow on its own.\xc2\xa0 I agree that it can grow on its own, but why whit for it to grow, when we can push it to grow.\xc2\xa0 If you have 100 BTC as an investment and the coin grows back to $1,400, you now have a $140,000 investment instead of the $209 you paid for it.\xc2\xa0 So I am amped to move this forward increasing the demand.\xc2\xa0 '
p7
aS'This is great idea. I think u need to explain him what is bitcoin and if u have friends that have coins also u can promise him a few customers, and he will not skip oportunity to earn some money. But before that u need to find out what law says. He needs to pay taxes and give bills, so I dont know how that can be regulated with law in your country ( cause i believe that depends from where are u from, different countrys different laws. I wish u luck with this plan, and it would be nice u to inform us from time to time whats happening with that.'
p8
aS'By starting your own local business and promoting the shit out of bitcoin. If you have it, they will come. Other vendors asking about why you accept bitcoin, people who have heard of that fake money before that come in anyways that are able to learn more than they knew about btc than before when they walked in the door. and eventually people that would choose to shop at these particular places solely because \'They take bitcoin"\xc2\xa0'
p9
aS'We should have basic local bitcoin infrastructure implemented, like bitcoin payment processors, exchange liquidity, local acceptance rate etc. Otherwise the local merchants have no point to pay extra for installing such system to accept BTC. '
p10
aS'Hi,Well i think you can encourage them by pointing out the most positive aspects of bitcoin. Also by stating which other big companies are using it e.g overstock etcThanks'
p11
aS"Trust me you don't want to to that .The moment bitcoins becomes commercial our corrupt government will start imposting all sorts of unwanted taxes for bitcoin users .For exam we will have government wallets only no private wallets allowed from where they will have track of all of your transactions .They will put taxes on every transaction .I'm afraid bitcoins will be a bitter truth to swallow if it gets commercialised ."
p12
aS'this all depends on which country you are talking about , till bitcoins is not leagally accepted in all countrys . it is not possible. if in your country bitcoins is allowed then\xc2\xa0 you can ask your local businesses that you want to buy in bitcoin, like this you can give details about bitcoins and its benefits . this way you can encourage local businesses to accept bitcoins also as their payment options.'
p13
aS"It's not as easy as you think, they're not going to start accepting because one person wants to pay with it, with time more people will start to use BTC and then it will happen automatically but still you can plant the idea in their head and explain to them what it is but only if they seem interested.Better idea is if you use some online stores/services tell them how you would have loved to pay with bitcoin."
p14
aS'The easiest way to accept bitcoin payments is in-person, simply by getting your customer to send the correct amount of bitcoin (BTC) to your digital wallet. This is similar to thinking of it as a cash-in-hand payment. This can be done via many smartphone apps, such as the Bitcoin Wallet app by Andreas Schildbach, on Android. There are also options available on the Windows Phone app store for users of that OS.read here http://www.coindesk.com/information/bitcoin-retail-pos-systems/'
p15
aS"Knightkon, I started to do a loan with you. The irony. This is what I did and you are welcome to copy my blueprint.Meetup.comLinkedIn local groups (financial services)These have been my best routes to go. What I did was go to the chamber of commerce and my local small business association. I set up a meeting room (50.00 for the hour) Made flyers. Joined other groups encouraging individuals to come listen to my spiel. Showed them the ins/outs of btc. I mainly targeted small business as most big businesses are either in it or they are not interested. It's very extreme here where I live. The biggest questions I had asked of me was how hard is it to cash out and were there places that could cash out quickly. I showed them the various wallet platforms and the exchange platforms.The first few meetings. Only a few bit and asked more. I'm still promoting and trying to encourage. I target pawn shops. Gold exchange. Art places. There are other places. I'm enthusiastic about btc and the direction it has the potential to go. I've also talked to individuals who played the stock markets\xc2\xa0 (surprisingly a good range of investors don't consider btc a solid foundation and rightfully so but the argument is there and I try to encourage people to keep their options open. Just do your diligence and stay on it. Keep the range low so they find it appealing. Often times I'll compare btc to a merchant account. You can have the equivalent of the fees taken from you but the option is your availability to the funds.It's definitely a challenge to help people make changes. Yet it's been worth it as I'm learning stuff everyday and meeting new people.Connect with me if you'd like me to provide more information. "
p16
aS"Thing is with services as bitpay you are a thief of your own wallet if you don't accept it.There are no risks because of the instant conversation."
p17
aS"Most people only want the benefits, and are not willing to do that.Maybe a good idea is where a user visit a protal and can vote for a shop to accept bitcoin. It's much easier. The webmaster then can built a bot that send a mail to the shop owner by ever XXX Votes."
p18
aS'You can start giving them free mBtc. Then you accept btc as the payment method.If people know how very easy bitcoin to use, then they will use bitcoin for their transaction.'
p19
aS'I think if there were a lot of people that simply ask "do you accept bitcoin" this would make the business think to themselves everyone is asking about this bitcoin thing let me find out what it is and then once they look into it they may adopt it or even come back to you to ask for more information.Other larger companies with an online space would have systems where they log support queries so over time if they keep getting the same query they will no doubt look into it or already be looking into it.'
p20
aS'If you or we run a business then it is the best way to start from ourselves.If not then we should tell and show them how other big businesses are accepting bitcoins.Telling them the bitcoin opportunities and how they can earn more if the price increases after the sales.'
p21
aS'maybe this one can help.Merchant bitcoin point-of-sale (POS) solutions.There is also a growing number of commerce-specific options that aim to streamline the process of taking bitcoin payments. The following services offer a variety of POS solutions for merchants, both online and off.CoinifyCoinify, a Danish firm that acquired BIPS and Coinzone, offers POS solutions for both brick-and-mortar and online stores. Merchants can get paid in bitcoin or fiat currency \xc2\x96 or a mixture of the two \xc2\x96 and its mobile app, Coinify POS, works with both Android and iOS devices.'
p22
aS'The only way to convince local businesses to accept a cryptocurrency is to offer them an incentive. They are highly unlikely to start accepting it just because they think the idea of a cryptocurrency is "cool" after learning about it in a seminar, as someone suggested earlier. This is the problem with BTC that Zeden (http://zeden.io/) tries to address. Zeden\'s referral program offers this incentive: refer someone to start using/accepting it, get 70% of all their transaction fees for the next 2 years. Therefore, someone who refers a local business to start accepting Zeden can benefit, and the local business can benefit by referring its customers. The local business can choose to discount its goods if the customers pay with Zeden, since after all, the local business could potentially receive a steady flow of passive income for the next 2 years from the people it refers. Therefore, local businesses and its customers may finally have an incentive to use it.'
p23
aS'You should make a group that you can explain to them what bitcoin is, how to use bitcoin and other. If you tell them one by one it will took a longer time. '
p24
aS"tell them about bitcoin is ease to use.Bitcoin is a great alternative because of the ease of use, ease of storage, security of storage,and it's also the only thing in the world you can send halfway around the world in less time than it takes to snap your fingers, and for free."
p25
aS"This is what I do:1) Don't buy from them if they don't accept bitcoin. When I have extra time, I'll let their manager know that if they accepted the easiest non-paper payment method on earth to accept... they would not only get me as a customer, but a very loyal customer. When it is companies like a coffee place, i'll tell them why I buy Starbucks coffee instead of their coffee: simply because I can buy a gift card for Starbucks with bitcoin.2) When EVER I tip someone, it's in bitcoin. Don't have a bitcoin wallet on your smart phone, eh? Then sorry... no tip for you. Actually, I've tipped easily over 100 individuals. I've only had 2 people refuse a tip--1 person who's phone died and they wouldn't accept a paper wallet, and another person who rudely tried to educate me on how to write a tip amount onto a merchant receipt. If it were worth my time, I would've showed them how to download apps on their phone "
p26
aS"You should all know: businesses don't care about accepting another form of money. They're flooded with requests from all sorts of companies. HOWEVER, they just want to know that they're going to get more customers. And the more loyal these customers, the better!"
p27
aS'It is really not easy since a low percentage of people know Bitcoin, especially explain to merchands.It is easier to explain to people who send/receive money internacionally the benefits of using Bitcoin.Introducing friends to start at Bitcoin world even collecting some sats from faucets is also a good idea.'
p28
aS'Yess i agree, in this case we need some support to convince our local business to start accepting bitcoin.The most affected support i think is government. Once they declare to support bitcoin , it will make easy task to do this.'
p29
aS'Just when you see that chart and bitcoin value if going up, you might want to announce discount sale and maybe 20% discount for buyers who will use BTC to buy your items. Once people asks about what BTC is, you show them some inforgraphic of BTC, there are infographics that already exist online. Sooner they might just buy btcs to you '
p30
aS"tell the about all advantage of bitcoin,the them that you also easy to use bitcoin.tell them bitcoin is a great alternative because of the ease of use, ease of storage, security of storage,and it's also the only thing in the world you can send halfway around the world in less time than it takes to snap your fingers, and for free."
p31
aS'But unfortunately bitcoin is not that easy to use, besides they will probably want to exchange the bitcoins into cash sooner or later, there are systems for online business but for physical business using bitcoins is a bit more complicated.'
p32
aS'Nah, I agree over these two guys, your point is so great. yeah, government will takes great impact if they "say" will adopting bitcoin, then we\'ll see bitcoin will be well known for a huge people.. '
p33
aS'I asked a friend t accept bitcoin. He told me it is too risky. The price is too volatile, he does not know the price for the next day.'
p34
aS'its very hard to explain bitcoin to a non-computer guy, no matte the age ...'
p35
aS'Even with the volatility risk, I think that business who accept Bitcoin could have a significant advantage from their competitors as more and more people become aware of Bitcoin everyday.IMO, business who accept Bitcoins can attract a new type of customers and makes them loyal.'
p36
aS'I mean that\'s great and all to try and promote Bitcoin that way, I mean I\'m still working through an internship program at the moment and work in the food/service industry still and would love to get a tip and talk about Bitcoin with someone like yourself, but fuck... Just because they don\'t feel like learning something when they are probably extremely busy and just want the convenience in receiving a normal tip is to be expected, shouldn\'t be considered "rude". They work hard, and litterally served you.. Why should you deny them tip when they are probably working for way under minimum wage?If I were you I would still offer the Bitcoin tips and promote them to getting a wallet, but if they don\'t want it, just say ok and move on to giving them that dirty fiat. You\'re essentially trying to tell them that fiat is no good and they should accept your digital gold, and it would make more of a statement if you tipped them more in fiat than you would have in Bitcoin. I would also suggest making a little business card or flyer to leave business or people who serve you, so when they do have a chance to sit down and relax after a hard days work, they might get really interested in what you had to say after all, and start reading what you left them. You don\'t have to completely stiff them a tip, now that\'s "rude".'
p37
aS'I always use this method, when I approach them. I ask them if they accept Bitcoin. If the reply is NO, I ask Why not? ~ If they say, What is Bitcoin - I would explain it shortly and direct them to online Bitcoin processors. ~ If they say, What is the advantage for them? - I would highlight the cost savings and the edge they have over \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0other companies that did not accept it yet. ~ If they say, There is not enough demand for it - I send friends to their business to ask this same question. It works 9 out of 10 times for me. Try that, it just works. ^hmf^'
p38
aS'Maybe sellers who fund retailers could give a discount for people who pay in bitcoin. This will encourage retailers to use bitcoin, and in turn, maybe ask their customers for bitcoin for their good.'
p39
aS'I think the easiest way is still a payment processor.- registration is free- they receive the full amount without paying any fees - there is no risk of holding any bitcoins- receiving fiat currencies is easier to handle for them in terms of accounting, taxes etc.basically its just like paypal minus the fees.They dont even have to know anything about bitcoins.Once they accept bitcoin and do actually have a significant number of bitcoin customers they can allways switch to accepting bitcoins directly and selling them on their own.'
p40
aS'The problem with this, still, is the problem with confirmation times in Bitcoin. If you are buying something expensive like an engagement ring or something like that, then sure, tx times don\'t really matter as much because the business is usually not that busy all the time, but say like at a fast food service, or somewhere that is constantly busy with people waiting behind you, you don\'t have the convenience of having to wait for the next block to be solved.I think every online business can use what you where talking about though, but since it\'s "local" I would think that you are buying something in person.'
p41
aS"Help them out with installing a system, most people aren't bothered to do it themselves. So if you offer to help them, they might consider doing it. "
p42
aS'I thought bitpay and coinbase have teams to do that. They are established bitcoin payment processors. They benefit from payment processing.'
p43
aS'The point is that its very fast in sending the bitcoins money to any one around the world. So if we all educate the local business owners in every countries then then the day will come when everyone accepts bitcoins and give bitcoins in digital wallet for any transactions.'
p44
aS'When the bitcoin price rise, it will be reported in main stream media. Local business owners might see the reports and try bitcoin.'
p45
aS'So far the media are not exactly behind Bitcoin. Most bitcoin related news is negative not objective and sometimes even false.To encourage local businesses we should trigger and approach them.'
p46
aS'The reason news outlets don\'t portray Bitcoin in any positive light, is because of the fact that most news outlets are indirectly controlled or influenced by government. We are passed the "laugh at them" phase, and now they are trying to remain on the "ignore them/discredit them" phase, before they have to embark on the "join them" phase.Until more people can see the benefits from a limited, digital, and p2p verifiable currency; then the government still finds them self not feel as threatened. When you start seeing major celebrities, or other influential people start supporting Bitcoin and our cause, by "tweeting" about it and celebrating it on social media, then that\'s when you\'ll start seeing some backlash from government.'
p47
aS"I'm a retailer, i'm in south of italy. Accepting bitcoin is cheaper than Credit card ( here we pay a fee not less that 1.5% per transaction on CC , but usually pay about 2,5% ). So i hope that customer pay me in BTC ... But simply customer usually doesn't know what is bitcoin!!!!!! So first i think is important to make use of BTC easy for all people, then paying pizza or buying Gold Ring (in my shop hope\xc2\xa0 ) with bitcoin will be the same as pay them with credit card or cash. Me too have difficult on bitcoin world, because this is full of tecnical word that was really difficult to understand (blockchain, hashrate, miners, block etc. ) ! People are afraid of unknown so they prefer to pay a little bit \xc2\xa0more for use somthig really simple to understand as a credit card.. "
p48
aS"@OP First I appreciate your effort to help bitcoin enter in to the day to day life by trying to to make it acceptable by the local business people.I think the only way is to make them aware of the best two advantages of bitcoin payment like easy way of sending and receiving money and it's irreversiblity in a personal/group and practical demonstration. "
p49
aS"introduce and teach them to use prospective employees using bitcoin, if he is interested in let's say you're going to pay for it with bitcoin if he follows everything you say about business would you do, explain the language of cool, maybe he will be interested\xc2\xa0 "
p50
aS"Just offer them a service like bitpay where they get extra sales and you earn on selling the coins realtime (conversion).For them it's a win so they will accept it."
p51
aS"Tell them what bitcoin is + tell them how to use it. Tell them the benefits of Bitcoin. E.G. They don't have to pay VAT for sales made through it. Show them ways to encorporate it into their business, such as: making programs that validate purchases for them so it is easier for their staff to use. "
p52
aS'I feel small independent business are crucial for growing bitcoin the more small companies like these that get involved can only help to spread the rise of bitcoin as a household name. It would be so much easier if some of these places accepted bitcoin and we as a community need to help spread the word.'
p53
aS'I own a Internet cafe Business here in the Philippines and i got a big banner outside that i accept bitcoin as mode of payment. earning 1M to 2M satoshis daily from few printing jobs.I teaching the children how use the faucets and earn their first bitcoins. Children Today will be the next generation user of Bitcoins.. '
p54
aS"I will also be into internet cafe later and will provide cellphone loads using coins.ph. I'm thinking if you get to have 50 people inquire about mobile loads, it could spread the word while you earn extra through the rebates.Bitcoin banner outside will do help and also the text provided by coins.ph will probably help bitcoin's exposure to the locals. "
p55
aS'That is the very good effort. Young people tend to accept new things faster and better than old people.'
p56
aS'Nice thought brother..Try to teach them(retailer shops, or any shop keeper) by btc as an worldwide online currency..Tell them advantages of them..And if he/she gets interested then automatically he/she will learn by themselves and will start accepting btc..'
p57
aS'More promotion material and more information about bitcoin is the key.Let people learn about bitcoin themself and they will be sold eventually. The same thing happened to me.'
p58
aS"If you the customer have to be the one to persuade your local business to take bitcoin, that's a sign that it's not ready to go big yet. It's got to be a no brainer. "
p59
aS'encouraging local business to accept BTCwould be much way harder than encouraging them to invest on BTCthe best way to encourage them was to create the greatest store which they will recognize, and shows them that you areaccepting BTC as the payment method.'
p60
aS"If there is a demand from local customers paying in BTC, the merchants will accept Bitcoin as soon as possible. The problem is we don't have local Bitcoin community! How could we encourage them to accept it? The firs thing we should do is to encourage more ppl adopt Bitcoin before encouraging local businesses!"
p61
aS"Yeah we need some team that handles the information and marketing part of bitcoin. The more the merrier.It's time to realize we can make this work.. together.."
p62
aS'More information is the key to succes. Please should be come aware and thus should we create awareness.From there businesses will feel the ruge to join, because they are miss out.'
p63
aS"In my country, BTC atleast made it on televison.From time to time it's on the news (television) and newspaper. It's not all negative they say, but most likely they are warning ppl, not to invest to much money.Well it's, for me, obvious that you should NOT invest all your Dollars, Euros, or what ever into BTC, but i think it's smart to invest atleast a bittle. If BTC keeps growing, and, without a bubble like end of\xc2\xa0 2013, u see BIG times for BTC with all of its investors "
p64
aS"I did consider it, however, I live in a rural area - no one here accepts btc, so that's why I decided against helping a friend who owns a pizza place. I figured, if it failed on him, and noone used it, he might be mad at me. Rather not do that kind of thing to friends, just me I guess... Would have been cool to be like the first place in like 200 miles to accept it officially tho. "
p65
aS'This does not seem like a good reason to not accept Bitcoin, its not like your friend needs to invest hours setting up a method of taking payment or a large amount of money in equipment.Your friend can easily sign up at Bitpay for a free account, with it he can then have 30 transactions a month or $1,000 daily and if he goes over that he only needs to pay 1% per transaction.Or he can just use a smartphone and QR code, send x BTC to the QR code on the counter and an employee checks to see if the BTC was sent. All he would really need is a cashier that can do simple math and can scan a QR code.'
p66
aS"That's interesting. May I ask which country you reside in?I've not heard of a country where bitcoin is getting attention on national television?"
p67
aS'The way to encourage using of bitcoin it to make them easy to understand for all people. Now only a little bit of people know what is a Bitcoin'
p68
aS"I guess making the price less volatile is 1.From there we should approach them and learn them about the potential of bitcoin.It's a 100% sale if they learn about the low fees."
p69
aS"In my experience, I have a friend who's also a guitarist, who is in a buy and sell.one day he decided to sell one of his\xc2\xa0 guitar pedal to me, it is cheap but I am short on cash, I told him that if I make him a bitcoin address and pay him with bitcoin would accept? he told me that he can't use it, but when I explained to him that he could use it to buy things online or buy cellphone load, then he told me that he will accept in the sense that he will return it if he got no use for it. but he never returned it to me. My point here is that by using part money and part bitcoin, we could encourage people to use it. and usually those small businesses were the first to start it and probably they'll spread it to other small businesses.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0"
p70
aS"If, there are more number of Bitcoin users in your place, its easy to convince that local business admin to accept bitcoin. But if there's lack in bitcoim users, its really hard and might be useless. And that local business admin should at least have some basic knowledge about tech, so that its easy to convince him.ORYou start a business and start accepts bitcoin as a payment gateway."
p71
aS'We encourage local businesses to accept bitcoin by firstly putting bitcoin stickers in the shops, near them, by making people being interested in this, talking with the employees and if we can talk directly to the director of a shop, explaining the pros and cons of bitcoin.'
p72
aS"Yes, it could be a good idea. Then is important to focus that if you use bitcoin you don't need bank\xc2\xa0 "
p73
aS"I don't think there is any good way to encourage local businesses to accept Bitcoin. People have to realise for themselves."
p74
aS'I like this idea.The moment they see stickers are any other promotion they will be intrigued as to what it is.If they then read bitcoin beats any other payment form with speed and low fees, they will join our revolution.'
p75
aS'This is very true... And when people in your local area start to adopt and store some of their wealth into Bitcoin, you should go to a business and just casually talk to them about Bitcoin. Maybe say, "Man, someone was just ranting and raving the other day about Bitcoin to me the other day, seems like everyone has... Has anyone talked to you about it yet?"... Or that kind of thing. Makes you seem more less annoying by just shoving info down their face right away. Plus if you start talking more about it I would just be like, "yeah, I would think if someone like your self started accepting Bitcoin for payments, I think you could gain an edge against your competitors."Businesses always want to have some sort of edge against any type of competition. The hardest part of this whole thing though is to actually get local people interested in Bitcoin enough to purchase some themselves, rather than getting the businesses in on the action.'
p76
aS'For that We have to first spread the bitcoin like Share about article or anything which is related bitcoin to Twitter or facebook or whatsapp. If common awareness comes in between the people mind automatically. Bitcoin will get the sense in the normal groceries and many shops.'
p77
aS"If local businesses would be able to integrate bitcoin easily with online payments (i.e. bitcoin) they would be able to try it.Currently there is no plug & play\xc2\xa0 method for them to 'try' it out."
p78
aS"But that's a lie, you do need a bank or some sort of online payment to even be able to buy bitcoins in the first place and you will eventually have to sell them to get dollars. Local business are not going to adopt bitcoin any time soon because it's simply not worth it for them, what are they gaining? A tedious payment method that can always go 100$ down in price in hours, so why would they use it?"
p79
aS'Proper guidelines help, but they need more.Remember these people are not techy at all.An easy explanation about what bitcoin is and how it can be used is also needed.'
p80
aS'not easy i think, not many people know btcfirst thing we must get them to know what is btc, especially in my country alot of people still confusing what is bitcoinwe need more promotion like putting bitcoin billboard, sticker and etc so they will wondering what is btc?and then try to research it..hopefully they will know'
p81
aS'Yes promotions are mandatory for bitcoin to succeed.To succeed we need merchants, and we have to reach out to them.'
p82
aS"Telling them about bitcoin won't do anything. No one would start accepting bitcoins because they know they are too volatile, there is no point in using bitcoins for an average merchant or shop or business. Unless bitcoin can stabilize I don't see why would any of them use it, do you?"
p83
aS'Local businesses are scared of accepting Bitcoin because the price is too volatile. We need to fix that first.'
p84
aS"It's really hard to encourage local businesses to accept btc now, because when you show to them the recent price chart they will be afraid because if they sell something they can not make profit if the price decreases."
p85
aS"I agree with you, but this can't be fixed.It's how this market is working and I don't see it changing.Too many people are just making too many profit out of it."
p86
aS'I ask one of my co business owners they can add BTC if the confirmation is instant.\xc2\xa0 '
p87
aS"Why the confirmation. The transfer is instant they can look it up right away. It's very uncommon for a transfer not to go true.So they should add it, if that's their only problem with bitcoin."
p88
aS'Thats the same with my country. There are no stores that accept Bitcoin. It really sucks.'
p89
aS'The problem with local businesses is that they are not owned by techie people.Explaining them how bitcoin works will be a big challenge.An ever big challenge will be to learn them how they can accept bitcoin.Proper documentation and guides are key to achieve such a thing.'
p90
aS'Just be patient. In a few years, there will be numerous stores in every country to accept bitcoin.'
p91
aS'Yelp has an "Accepts Bitcoin" flag: http://officialblog.yelp.com/2014/04/now-on-yelp-businesses-that-accept-bitcoin.htmlUnfortunately when I type "bitcoin" and "accepts bitcoin" in the search, it doesn\'t filter to only bitcoin-accepting businesses.'
p92
aS"Price volatility is the major problem here - If you are running online store, you could have prices changing dynamically according to the BTC/USD rate. But what if you are running brick and mortar shop, where every product has it's own paper price label? Moreover, there is general factor of insecurity related to the price fluctuations, what could discourage people to adopt BTC."
p93
aS'Larger companies like Tesco, Morrisons and Argos in the UK could use a clic-and-collect style system with people already in ther store. This wouldmean that their system could detect payments as fast as normal ordering systems and a user would be able to order with Bitcoin. Even if they were to use a large company like Coinbase to make their transactions directly converted from BTC to \xc2\xa3. '
p94
aS'we should show them how the bitcoin works. we have to prove its existence and the big question ia that bitcoin price is so voilent'
p95
aS'Get some fair points out thereMoney is getting more Digital nowadaysLess physical currency in the stores will make robbers less to rob storesPhones being used to pay in certain stores now But inform them about the virtual safety i guess'
p96
aS'With the violent bitcoin price, it means the local business will not keep the bitcoin they receive. So they will have to sell straight away.'
p97
aS'Well, the main point to make businesses accept bitcoin is coming and say:"hey! You know how you pay 3 taxes each time you sell something? And you know how less and less people use cash so you have to pay taxes on it too?Well good news! On bitcoin the only tax you pay is the fee to send the money in your pocket! And it\'s around half a cent each time!"'
p98
aS'We did a little experiment today with one of the smaller merchants in our city. We {7 people} went there at different times of the day, and we thanked the merchant for accepting Bitcoin payment. He obviously did not know what we were talking about, and we told him that a speaker at one of our Bitcoin meetups, told us that they were accepting Bitcoins. This was obviously not true and just part of the experiment... He quickly got intrigued and wanted to know more... We re-directed him to a Bitcoin payment processor. In a week we will go back and see if they accept Bitcoins now. \xc2\xa0'
p99
aS"Promote BTC to your friends who own businesses... it's a great way to make them accept BTC in their stores..."
p100
aS'yeah, that is one of the best way to convince businessman to start using bitcoin, by promoting bitcoin to your friends first. mostly small businesses are the best to start with and easier to convinced...'
p101
aS'I think its pretty difficult to do that, because it has a bad name.The most stores are not convinced by the bitcoin.I think it will come but it will take several years before it would happen.'
p102
aS"By bad name what do you mean?You're talking about btc reputation? Well true it's not perfectly shiny... You could always try to explain of course, but yeah not sure it'll work out perfectly well ... Or do you really talk about the name of btc? Like from a marketing perspective? Cause if that's it... Well I totally disagree ^^Btc marketing is excellent, good name, good image, good spreading ^^"
p103
aS'it is little difficult, the first you need to explain and introduce to them what is bitcoin, after that you need to convert bitcoin to fiat every day to state the selling bitcoin price and then does infrastructure for bitcoin payment already available for the storeI think to encourage still need a lot of things to cover and to improve'
p104
aS"first they need to know what is it and how it works,once they'll have enough info i'm sure that they will start accepting them"
p105
aS"Thing is, that a lot of people still use normal money and not bitcoins, so i don't think they would accept bitcoins for 5 persons"
p106
aS"It would be a little difficult. most of their capital is fiat, but if we educate them about bitcoin, and they are convinced then they're in.. but I think it needs to start from their boss, if the boss is open to bitcoin idea, then its good..\xc2\xa0 "
p107
aS'Going to the boss and trying to implement the bitcoin in his business. As a part in your region you can start a small business that accepts bitcoins so that when days pass you will be benefited and automatically surrounding business people will adopt it'
p108
aS'That is true... we should be the one who should start it in our community..a small burger stand or a mini store could be a good one.\xc2\xa0 '
p109
aS"my friend has a coffee bar and i talked to him about bitcoin, for him it's too risky, but i convinced him to receive btc from me when i buy a coffe, for the moment he is happy whit the 0.05 made from my coffess"
p110
aS"True, lokal businesses are interested in the lokal fiat. They don't want to have exchange it and get later lessfiat for the same amount of Btc. Or become scammed during trading and get nohing at all."
p111
aS"the fact is that this guy loved bitcoin from the first transaction, but if you run a local business it's to risky due the volatility and also because in my country few people use bitcoin"
p112
aS'That is also the one reason but the most important reason is until government dont take initiative and accepts Bitcoin Technology , the Local or big business peoples cannot accept bitcoin as they cannot show the business through bitcoin in their Income Tax. and if some country are banned for Bitcoin use then it become illegal business also. so where their is clear picture about bitcoin in that country the peoples and business people can take benefit of Bitcoin Technology '
p113
aS'I aggree thats a huge block..I think local bussineses are afraid,unaware and skeptical on bitcoin, thats why they dont see bitcoin on their advantage. I think it will be easy for local businesess to accept bitcoin if their will be a huge and consistent consumer of bitcoin and goverment will have the initiative and support bitcoin.'
p114
aS'Local business needs to adopt bitcoin. The better method I think is just to implement the bitcoin in small scale logistics industry, as more of various country people get involved in business. In such the transaction can be made faster with less transaction charges.'
p115
aS"Well if you have a website then this is a good idea since you can send bitcoin through online but if you have a local store and thinking about bitcoin as a payment then you're crazy **no offence**  "
p116
aS'Bit coin is alive because of public support and till this support remains the bit coin will keep spreading .'
p117
aS'That is right. I told my family and friends about bitcoin, one of them have bought and used bitcoins. '
p118
aS'start a tv channel about bitcoin and the possibilities are endless, you can start a gaming show where the person \xc2\xa0answer questions right, go inside a bitcoin mining factory and explain the ins and outs, make a music video about bitcoins. if you think my idea can grow\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0it would be grateful to send a tip.'
p119
aS"I think it's hard to convince a local business owner to accept bitcoin as payment...bitcoin would always look strange to them.. Probably we can't convince them if their mind is close about accepting this currency..But, if they themselves are collecting bitcoin and investing in it then the chance that they will accept it is big..I think one of the easiest one to convince are those selling computer parts and other electronics, they have access in internet for sure and has an idea what is bitcoin..."
p120
aS'I have accepted bitcoin 1 time for my business. Not many people really still know about btc. '
p121
aS'not easy to encourage local and small bussiness to accept bitcoin,the only one should you do is getting closer to the owner,tell them about bitcoin,and tell them some reason that bitcoin would make their bussiness better.'
p122
aS'faster,cheaper,low fee and anonymously. its benefit for long distance or undirect transaction with bitcoin,yes i think so,bitcoin easier to use in online transaction,its why not easy to encourage people who have real store or direct transaction to accept bitcoin,'
p123
aS"I have found that food truck operators that have the ability (and familiarity) to use an electronic payment system, are often really eager to hear about bitcoin. I'm guessing those guys aren't too picky about their customer base, but we got a snowball stand and a cupcake truck to accept btc after kicking it with the owners a bit. To be fair, they were hipster (not saying this as a slight, but a indication they are familiar with current consumer technology) but hey, adoption is adoption."
p124
aS'its normally happen,even people who have good knowledge about internet payment,they not easy to accept bitcoin as part of their payment,the problem is they too afraid with regulate of goverment to bitcoin.'
p125
aS'That is the point! I make yours my words. The money last more and is more usefull on our hands in BTC. We can buy more for less because there is small fees, easy and fast transactions. People just need to start believing that BTC can be used on their routine like any other coin.'
p126
aS'encourage local businesses to accept BTC is not easy,its depending how good knowledge of the store owner to internet marketing and internet payment,so far i getting hard to tell people to start accepting bitcoin as their payment.'
p127
aS"just tell them how good bitcoin is, share news about bitcoin in internet, tell about how bitcoin is safe with all that huge security so others won't use your money, tell them how it is easy to use, it may take some time but with time, more and more stores will accept bitcoins"
p128
aS"perhaps showing them the price of how btc goes down and raises back to get them confident into a cryptocurrency as i suppose right now because its digital, people can't see the physical product they might just use back the original currency"
p129
aS"The above quote is a good description about bitcoin in local business. I believe at present bitcoin in business at present won't profit you much but the initiative made right now will lead to a great profit in the future days of bitcoin."
p130
aS"Just contact them and tell some profits they would make with the coin. Don't be to happy about it and keep the facts real. If big company's want to deal with the coin other small ones will also be in for it."
p131
aS'Depends on the level of a business big like you mentioned is preferred. But lets say if its a family business the odds of them to adopt it is not likely, depending on their financial situation.The last thing a family business wants is a a price gamble on their heads. Its way better if mid sized business adopt or the ones that have very good food traffic. '
p132
aS'if youve got friends relatives with different trades of businesses you can set a meeting even start with a small group and defining bitcoin and its uses. and make sure you have the right tools in presenting it like examples of a wallet how it is being traded and so on.\xc2\xa0 if its difficult for them to pick things up just give them a simple idea about your topic and later keep in touch to make some follow ups or up dates to complete the information campaign your presenting.\xc2\xa0  '
p133
aS'Its quite difficult to encourage the local because the price of bitcoin was up and down everyday, so it affected their income, maybe that is one of the reason the local difficult to accept bitcoin as a payment'
p134
aS"I think they would accept bit coins if there is more publicity for the coins. And of course they will acceptthem when other big company's takes the first step. I know almost for sure if big company's first introducing the coinothers will follow as well."
p135
aS'By just telling them that Bitcoins transaction doesnt have any fee. '
p136
aS'The bitcoin transaction does have some fee. The average cost is about $0.04. It is much lower than Payapl.'
p137
aS'I like to start with my money. If you want my money then you will have to accept my money, which is bitcoin. I have helped many businesses in the last 5+ years to get set up with BTC. Normally I demonstrate the system by being their first bitcoin customer. Typically they choose to use a payment processor because it requires very little staff training and minimizes risks. This is also 2% less than a credit card and they receive a deposit in their bank account that same day.\xc2\xa0 After following up with these businesses they often report few or no additional BTC sales. Some however have had great success and all have been happy to be able to offer an additional payment option with almost zero cost or obligation. So my advice is to "show them the money!" '
p138
aS'Well they have to see the advantages of the bitcoin, if they see the advantages they will soon or later use it.The fact that its controllable by themselves makes it in my eyes pretty attractable.'
p139
aS"The main thing needed is to make bitcoin both more acceptable and more appealing.I know the concept is built around a decentralised system, but there needs to be something built in to prevent the con artists from running away with your coins.I really have no idea on how this can be done.\xc2\xa0 I run a SME with a few outlets, but would never dream of accepting bitcoin in its present form !!I also run a couple of bitcoin faucets, but can never envisage linking the two.Trust is a major factor in doing business, unfortunately Bitcoin just hasn't been able to reach the level of trust that would make mainstream business believe.get mainstream business involved and public will follow"
p140
aS'Maybe the reason business sector dont believe bitcoin is for its price, because bitcoin price is unstable and their so many different ways it will die if something bad happen unlike other processor they have fix amount, but really bitcoins need to be more appealing to public because not all people use it, it didnt reach to the knowledge of not techy people, and if majority of people uses bitcoin well i really see business shops will accept it as they knew it can profitable for them.'
p141
aS'We now have teams from the trading sector i mean the legitimate traders who found ways conducting information campaigns. \xc2\xa0in your region they might need something like this.'
p142
aS'Right now only way of encouraging bitcoin in business is in the hands of big offline shops. Let that be a grocery, stationary, food court or anything. Always small shops follow business methods of big shops. So this will encourage the small scale business to use bitcoin in their services as an additional option.'
p143
aS'i can list down how to encourage local business to use bitcoin because these is also factors that they may look bitcoin profitable for them if they really accept it and it can be transaction breakthrough\xc2\xa0 for business sector.1. Numbers of Users- by this if many user use bitcoin well it can encourage them because they can see it nice to use with the more user the more attention they will get.2. Price stability- because of unstability of price some business afraid to adopt it because if price will drop they will lose big money.3. History- history really tells and i think it will be helpful fpr business to look thw history of this coin by that it will also tell the future.'
p144
aS'Well the main problem there is no marketing team. Bitcoin is for the people and the people should arrange everything. Which means do all the work. So far spreading the word seems to help, but the growth and impact seems minimal to me.'
p145
aS'Move Bitcoin forward into our economy is hard to do that if many of your country didnt use bitcoin. Its hard because few people only know this Digital currency. And if they accept they think that who use this as a payment? So for me teach first all of your countrymen to know what is bitcoin, what is the purpose of this in your life, and many more so if you can refer them to use it many of your country men use it and soon you can request to the some establishment that they accept bitcoin.'
p146
aS'In order to expand the uses of btc in ones area you have to make an information campaign, whereby one must present the uses and advantages of bitcoin to subjects.\xc2\xa0 It has to be well explained and well presented so the subjects being presented would have a fast catch up regarding the topic.\xc2\xa0 You can set a small group meeting, start within your circle of friends and make sure that they will apply what they learned thus after that small group make another meeting to have a growing community of btc users.\xc2\xa0 The most important of this all is that they understand what you presented.\xc2\xa0 Because without understanding there will be no long term application.'
p147
aS'I think education is the key For business sector to accept bitcoin because if they have proper knowledge what and where are the main factors they can use bitcoin with, by then thet can decide to accept it and also they can lessen the transaction fee if really they will adopt it surely by that many people same as bitcoin user will be hapoy if the time really happen, and also one factor can be consider to online shop owner is the number of user worldwide because the wider the market the more profit they will get, maybe they reconsider and looking for it by now but its hard for them to decide because its corporate money we are talking here.'
p148
aS"if you go for corporate then i'm sure everyone in the corporate sector knows what they are in they can make divisions or branches within the corp to have specific task or goal.\xc2\xa0 And i'm pretty sure information campaign would be one of the keys to open the minds of anyone to expand your bitcoin users community."
p149
aS"agree with that,i'm sure if big offline shops start accept bitcoin as payment and goes mainstream,then small offline shop like grocery or food court will follow this step,this like a mainstream technology that spreading automaticly because trends. "
p150
aS'But realy its very hard for accept bitcoin because some of them dont know about it for now and i think the proper way to promobitbitcoin for now is by do blog about it and youtube my help for its awareness maybe i think for bitcoin well be seen by business sector is by marketing it, if business man see the wide market of bitcoin and numbers of user well i can say they will accept it because they will grab the oppurtunity where they can benifit and if online shop accept it maybe the offline store will follow it to accept bitcoins. '
p151
aS'Yeah its really difficult to encourage local business but if they can show them a proof that bitcoin is money and many people are using it maybe they can accept bitcoin in their business and show them how bitcoin works.. and i think bitcoin is good in arcade business like malls timezone that accept coin and change it into bitcoin instead of coins or card bitcoin is their credit..'
p152
aS'One of the strategy to let local businesses around your area get to adopt bitcoin is to present and introduce this to the one\'s who are definitely active in using the current technology.\xc2\xa0 Because they are the one\'s who is gonna demand for its market usage.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It is like inquiring to any establishment if "Do you accept bitcoins here?"\xc2\xa0 So if the demand goes higher then the local businesses will find ways to address the payment mode of the costumer.\xc2\xa0 So if possible you have to educate both. '
p153
aS'Although its hard for them to accept bitcoin for now because may they are afraid for its price stability but if the see the wider market of bitcoin is and global number of users well i can say maybe they well consider it, but really maybe they are watching bitcoins for now just like steam it is accepted by them this year maybe foe incoming years maybe we can see it slowly adopted and accepted by online and also offline shop. '
p154
aS'It\xc2\x92s the first example of a growing category of money known as cryptocurrency.Bitcoin can be used to buy things electronically. In that sense, it\xc2\x92s like conventional dollars, euros, or yen, which are also traded digitally. So I think there is no question to encourage on local business . '
p155
aS"Yes it is.\xc2\xa0 So it is possible to give them idea's of how it will materialize in any transactions or trades.\xc2\xa0 Especially for local businesses we must let them show the demand of the trading system that does not requires clearings or verification's."
p156
aS'you can invite them to seminar about bitcoins or so, because telling them all at once will be much easier than to tell same stuff to each one, it would take way too much timeand about stuff that you should tell them, tell how it is easy to use them and how easy to receive payment from buyers, and i am sure than they all should be interesting in them'
p157
aS'The easiest way is to visit them and just show them all the advantages of Bitcoins.And not just show it to them by whitepaper.. but also show them practically.'
p158
aS"Always give a complete package in educating your audience for them to completely understand and to have less questions asked after the presentation. \xc2\xa0And don't forget to make a demo."
p159
aS'Make a good presentation about bitcoin and how it works. Include the current list of businesses or company that is using bitcoin as a payment method. Engage them in a definite example of receiving and sending bitcoins to one address to another. Last but not the least is to tell them that accepting bitcoin as MOP will surely result in increase of sales.'
p160
aS''
p161
aS'Presentation is very good idea but who will step up for doing that and introduce it to business sector? Well i think for now and in this state is we need to show business sector our volume and how widely the market in bitcoin, the number of users and compatibility if they used bitcoin, by that theirs no really doubt that they will accept bitcoin as their mode of payment knowing bitcoins market are widing now all over the world and maybe they really consider aswell as they looking at the bitcoin for now and studying that it is worth for them to stake with this coin, but really if business sectors will accept bitcoin well it can make our life more easier.'
p162
aS'Who will step up to introduce it? You can ask it to OP\xc2\xa0  or to other persons who is similar with him, persons that want to help in announcing how bitcoin is truly an awesome creation for our whole wide world.'
p163
aS'I think you must explain the features of bitcoin interms of its transactions and reliability.But if you will teach and explain it to them one by one on evefyone who\xc2\xa0 will place an order to you that will take time.You must have a blog or page for your business and explain it to them in that way it will\xc2\xa0 b faster and a lot easier.You must explain to them aboutfees and transaction in bitcoin'
p164
aS"I'm also thinking this, if we can show them the advantages of the bitcoin they will like it without any doubts, I think its just a way of explaining them the advantages that is just the only thing. "
p165
aS'Honestly as my notice they are just afraid to be scam so if they see that bitcoin is not scam they can accept it in their business.. But for now for those who already know bitcoin they know the investment site and experience of scam i think we can not encourage them back here in bitcoin..'
p166
aS'We need to first introduce Bitcoins in the public and to the business owners. We should give examples of the business currently accepting the bitcoins and how the bitcoins has transformed their business. Once we are able to convince them, then they might adopt bitcoin for their business.'
p167
aS"Bitcoin isn't something for physical stores. That's why we don't use PayPal to buy coffees. It's not beneficial for an online store. That's why every store I go to, i contact their sorry and ask if they accept bitcoin."
p168
aS"Bitcoin is suitable for local business. That's why the QR code etc. is there.With creditcards the validation happens after the transaction, with bitcoin it happens seconds after the transaction which makes bitcoin better for merchants then credit card.The problem is software behind it is complex and merchants are not very techy, so it must be made easy for them."
p169
aS'I think first off you\'d have to convince people to spend their BTC. Many of the people I know who introduced bitcoin payment for their services don\'t get many customers of that sort, so why bother to learn about it, since they "know all about doing business"? I have a feeling the cc market is mostly about trading, buying low, selling high. '
p170
aS"Indeed the most important thing is that we have to mention the very good advantages it has compared with other currency's from these days."
p171
aS'I think we need to explain them the benefits of accepting bitcoin as a currency and also explain them the possible price hike after halving.'
p172
aS'i think that you should invite them all to one place and tell them everything at once, because you would take too much time to tell same stuff to each one of themand you should tell how bitcoin is good how it is easy to use it and receive payment from buyers and i am sure that they will like it, and they will accept bitcoins when there will be plenty of buyers ofc'
p173
aS"In my experience, I have a friend who's also a guitarist, who is in a buy and sell.one day he decided to sell one of his\xc2\xa0 guitar pedal to me, it is cheap but I am short on cash, I told him that if I make him a bitcoin address and pay him with bitcoin would accept? he told me that he can't use it, but when I explained to him that he could use it to buy things online or buy cellphone load, then he told me that he will accept in the sense that he will return it if he got no use for it. but he never returned it to me.My point here is that by using part money and part bitcoin, we could encourage people to use it. and usually those small businesses were the first to start it and probably they'll spread it to other small businesses."
p174
aS"The best thing to do would be to gather all these small businesses together for a meeting and introduce them to the concept in simple and realistic terms, using lots of data to back up and prove your pointsThese people are interested in profit, so make sure you show them how beneficial and easy this can be, and you should be fine, however, at the same time they're not morons so please don't attempt to hide some down sides, instead present them and suggest easy fix solutions"
p175
aS'It is very hard to encourage local businesses to accept it due to "Confirmations" and breaching, that just is not safe enough for them IN THEIR eyes.It would be nice to just send a few mB to a company and get a slice of pizza though'
p176
aS"That's awesome, but sadly we dont all have business friends that will accept btc, but it is a great idea to make local businesses accept it because then i can buy stuff just sitting on my computer then go pick it up later right after gambling!This would be amazing but also make people very lazy."
p177
aS"Yes that will make people very lazy and that's a bad thing but you really have to look at it like BTC will be a future use and you'll see it upcoming in the halving process."
p178
aS'The savings on credit card transaction and processing fees are a reason for retailers to consider accepting bitcoin. Banks also usually have setup, maintenance, and processing fees for a business account. Adoption will take place as business owners become more aware of BTC and digital banking.'
p179
aS'If you can show them what kind of advantages the bitcoin has they will like it and show some interests for sure.The fact that they can control their own money makes it mostly very nice.'
p180
aS'But, it is possible to use bitcoins in physical stores via bitcoin debit cards (similarly with paypal debit card).I think if we could also try to establish a local exchange so bitcoin will become popular in our area. That will help local business to accept bitcoins.'
p181
aS'A nice story you got there, a mix of bitcoin and paper money sounds legitimate way I hope I could also try that with my friends. In my humble opinion bitcoin will become very popular within the next few years so it is the right time now to introduce it to our friends and fellows.'
p182
aS"Spreading the word is 1 of the things that will help bitcoin grow. Another good thing is to approach merchants and ask them why they don't accept bitcoin yet.Point them to the bitcoin site so they can learn about it."
p183
aS'I think we need to visit all the merchants and shop keepers near us and give them education about bitcoins. I am sure they are not using bitcoins as they are not aware of this.We have to play our part to get this done. and once they know about the coins they will implement it in their business.'
p184
aS'To a business to be continuance , you have to adjust to the developing technology and you have to enhance it and be one step ahead from the competitors of your own , mostly meet your customers requirements, as bitcoin is growing and its cheaper and faster and all the organization are using it to buy services and products, you have to convince your retailers to enhance the bitcoin, you have to have an idea of how your going to implement the bitcoin over them to be a better an successful businessman.'
p185
aS'i think this is the most important question i have seen in the whole spread sheet. i think it is one of he most difficult job and specially in our are where most of the businessmen are illustrate and do not know anything about bitcoin but still we can make an effort to encourage them . i think we should start from those businessmen who are educated they will easily understand our statement. we can show the the present progress of the bitcoin. '
p186
aS'This is true for every shopman too. They do not want to change or accept a change. I myself had tried to convince a shop keeper of using bitcoins also but he refused by saying that no one in his area has bitcoins to spent.'
p187
aS'In my opinion as long we accept scam like ponzi, hyip and all the other shit which destroy the image of this wonderfull invetion there will be no good future for bitcoin. It still will be a currency of the criminals. There have to be a rethinking.'
p188
aS'there is no need to worry. bitcoin is too strong now. now one can effect its image. the people are entering and investing their money here in a large amount. we need to motivate the local businessmen. for this purpose we have to visit them and show them our own progress in bitcoin. i think they need a very regular instruction about bitcoin. '
p189
aS'Well i actually doubt we can.The reason is\xc2\xa0 they are having too low amount of customers to get it worthy for them.I mean of course not 100% people on earth use bitcoin,lets say its 5% of ppl.So if they run a buissness and get lets say 100 customers day,its not worth it to start a new service to get only 5 customers daily payed with BTC.Maybe in many years,when btc will get more popular,then we can.'
p190
aS'First you need to get all the online retailers to start accepting bitcoins and then spreading the word out in the local business industry. Maybe workshops and seminars might help with this, online you can stream a seminar on youtube or any other video streaming site and out in the public you can invite people from the business industry to attend too.'
p191
aS'Possible with something like a Mastercard BTC Card.\xc2\xa0 With some stores with no options of accepting cards, that may be difficult since they have to upgrade to some tech stuff first, the costs of upgrading some are not willing to gamble into.\xc2\xa0 But those establishments that accepts credit and debit card payments, all we need is to wait for bitcoin to become part of the mainstream alternative currency.\xc2\xa0 '
p192
aS'Right now much of profit can be earned from bitcoin if implemented into local businesses. Just a foundation for a later profit can be laid. Also the person who knows much about bitcoin nature can start bitcoin into their business rather than using it without any knowledge, just with focus of profit.'
p193
aS"For the local business men to accept the bitcoins, we need to give them awareness through training's and promotions. We need to convenience them that using bitcoin in their\xc2\xa0 business will be more beneficial for them. Businessman will only be interested in it, if they know it wont cost them extra money to invest in."
p194
aS'You are 100% right,but another problem we can find is that not too many people use bitcoin in some countries,so if like 3% of their customers use bitcoin,why would they implement it? just not worth it at all for small buissnesses'
p195
aS"i'd love to see the stats from businesses that started accepting it six months down the line. i've read that a few food vans and stuff stopped because they hardly got any business from it but wasted loads of time talking to people about it. "
p196
aS"Well, you would probably work with smaller business. Show them the how Bitcoin transactions work and how easy it is to function.Simple as a barcode being scanned with a mobile phone application.Just explain the concept of Bitcoin and the perks / cons.This is a true statement. But I've used Bitcoin in a public place as a form of payment and it is really convenient. Any growth with Bitcoin is a good thing."
p197
aS'But for the years past Bitcoins really gather more popularity to people and online business stores some of them are accepting it already and if bitcoins still keep spreading his fame well theirs no doubt for it to be accepted in business sector or even in physical store since bitcoin has great potential to take over those online mode of payments processors and if the businessman will see the larger market of bitcoins with im pretty sure they will adopt this coin in near future'
p198
aS"I agree that for the local store to accept bitcoin, we need to introduce bitcoin to them, going to them one by one is really a hard thing to do, best way is to set up an appointment to the business group and introduce bitcoin to them. \xc2\xa0In this meeting tackle why do they need to adopt Bitcoinand it's positive features. Some of it's basic technicalities and of course prepare a video and a demo (actual hand on).I don't believe tht Bitcoin isn't something for physical stores, swiping cards are already implemented, why not send transaction thru your mobile phone. \xc2\xa0I believe that if you really want to implement something you will make a way for it. \xc2\xa0FYI, sending Bitcoin thru Android phone is easier process than swiping a \xc2\xa0Card."
p199
aS"I also think that we first need to have a lot more online stores accepting the bitcoin only on that we can also encourage other locally company's.The bitcoin also needs to get more used before this is gonna happen!"
p200
aS'yes that is also a fact. and our area that is such a difficult job i think because in our are the local business men are mostly ignorant and they do not have any idea about computer and internet. they also have no idea about bitcoin. so it is really a difficult job. '
p201
aS"you might be right,but i think i would say it other way.They are ignorant,but you need to not forget about that it is not probably worth to launch something like this,if their client's even dont ask about bitcoin,why should they do something like this? stupid idea right? hahaha"
p202
aS"Local businessmen are not dealing with the internet too much. Which is why millions of local shops dissapear and will keep dissapearing. They can't compete with the internet shops, since internet shop are cheap and have less cost (of a prime location in a shopping mall f.e)."
p203
aS"This. After a while, they asked merchants that had started accepting bitcoin how many customers were still paying in bitcoin. It seems after an initial burst of spending, the novelty wears off and people go back to spending fiat. This was seen in UK, and that little town that had the 'bitcoin bowl'. "
p204
aS"What the hell is a bitcoin bowl,lol?I would like to pay taxes in bitcoin's lol that would be really cool but i guess the governement would cry a lot if someone would want to implement this "
p205
aS'I think you can explain that bitcoin is money and it is simple, new innovation and more safe than reversible services payment are like paypal, skrill and neteller. With use bitcoin it will take costumers from another countries not local only.'
p206
aS"If their business is running on fiat, it will really take a long time to consider adding bitcoin payment as an option since price fluctuates and $1 value of bitcoin is not $1 value in just few days.This kind of system required a brainstorming on how a merchant will deal with bitcoin's active price fluctuations."
p207
aS'That is right. In order for the bitcoin price to be stable so that more people will use it, we need some price stability mechanism.'
p208
aS"You are gonna love this\xc2\xa0 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_BowlWe don't talk about this anymore, because it ended badly."
p209
aS'The best idea to encourage local businesses to accept btc for me is just show them how many of theircustomers use/earn in bitcoins,they could be really amazed and implement bitcoin payments,and that would be really cool!'
p210
aS'How do you go about approaching them and what is it with you? Those businesses may ask this question to you, so will you earn too if they adopt BTC when they are selling noodle soap on the streets? But then halving them use Bitcoin can certainly help spread the word about bitcoin and the Economy.'
p211
aS"I have a simple solution.Just hire one person more in you're business,which would ask people about if they would like to pay herewith bitcoin's,online or at the shop.It is not hard to get research,right? At least that what i think."
p212
aS'It is difficulty to pay the goods in the shop. The confirmation time is too long. It can only be used online.'
p213
aS'Maybe in the future these confirmations will be <10 minutes. But for now this is a problem for stores that has a long line of customers.'
p214
aS"First you need to introduce bitcoin, some merchants don't know what bitcoin is and more probably in third world countries that I'm living. Just plan to start first to give waiver that states what is bitcoin and if they want to know visit the specific address and date, like having an event. Then have the event on an area where more people is use to walk and maybe they can notice you and listen to you."
p215
aS'\xc2\xa0Make a good presentation about bitcoin and how it works. Include the current list of businesses or company that is using bitcoin as a payment method. Engage them in a definite example of receiving and sending bitcoins to one address to another. Last but not the least is to tell them that accepting bitcoin as MOP will surely result in increase of sales..'
p216
aS'This is effective if you working in a merchant company then you will show some proposals.But if you are just a normal person requesting it in a merchant, then it will goes thru a hard way before they will hear your concern.'
p217
aS"You can also do an online group for businesses that want to know about bitcoin. Ask them first and make them know what's the benefit of bitcoin for them, once they got curious give them time to meet you and explain all the things that they need to know."
p218
aS"I agree, I've been in BPO industry before and what we do is to call a person that owns a certain business, unfortunately we can't talk that long because the guy has a full load on his time so he can only have 2 minutes of conversation, they don't even have time to sit in front of their computer."
p219
aS"The best way to encourage local businessness is just showing them that bitcoin is known very good.It is popular,many people uses it and it is fairly great to pay for anything.Isn't just perfect for them?"
p220
aS'Some shops already have qr codes to pay. Show them how easy and cheap it is to setup a qr transaction and how to include intirgrate of bitcoin within the store .'
p221
aS'I think it is difficult to make the business integrated with bitcoin, especially if your country is still less understand what it bitcoin. But for countries like U.S and Britain is already very advanced and many already understand bitcoin it could be done, although still difficult I guess.so it is better not to encourage local businesses to use bitcoin if it is felt this is not possible. Because it can be very easy for buyers but not necessarily will produce a profit for the seller.'
p222
aS'I think it would be effective on those rich one and i really think the best thing to introduce bitcoins to business sector is to show our growing number of users and also the price,transaction fee and how smoothly the deal has been done if they will apply bitcoin as mod of payments to each company. on other hand also business sector might notice bitcoin if some company who holding it includes bitcoin on their advertising so by that way also bitcoin can have exposure to global market.'
p223
aS"As of today, it would be hard since Bitcoin isn't popular in some countries especially on third world countries. It would be possible on some because already lot of people knows about btc. I think it would happen in next 5 years I guess."
p224
aS"I'm from a third world country and bitcoins are quite popular here.You can buy a pizza/recharge your phone/pay your bills/we have more than 5 online exchanges for our country.So please refrain from making such comments,be specific about the names you intend to mention."
p225
aS'While its not bad to achieve both the local businesses to also accept Bitcoin,\xc2\xa0 the word about bitcoin may just be spread widely if its also used and accepted widely by online users to huge auction and ecommerce sites such as Amazon and the likes. With it being used online, we need not to encourage local business but they may initiate by themselves.'
p226
aS'Yeah, im seeing 2020 as bitcoin used as payment. It is only 2016 and many shops are now accepting bitcoins as payment. It is because they are seeing the potential of this coin. And sooner or later, larger companies will then add bitcoins as their Mode of Payment. Why? Because the fact that bitcoin is very convenient to use, especially now that gadgets dominate the world. We just have to upgrade the security of our accounts from hackers especially those huge companies that will store millions or even billions of their investment. And if we do that, I think the bitcoin community will bloom like a flower from a bud.'
p227
aS"Problem is most people don't see bitcoin as a legal currency because media don't allow it to happen. They don't want people to know bitcoin becauseif that would there's a high chance that it will crash the banks we have that use to inflate our paper money."
p228
aS'#Even though the media do not report it positively, it will take some time for the people to realise the benefit of bitcoin.'
p229
aS'yeah that is the best idea but first we should teach them what really is bitcoin and tell them all the advantges of accepting bitcoin as a payment processor so that they will be more good to go with it !'
p230
aS"Do you have local bitcoin exchanges with low transaction fees for the retailers to exchange fiat with coins?Because if you don't, the retailers won't lift a finger."
p231
aS"I saw someone on Politics & Society section, there's one guy that promoting bitcoin using QR code with his T-shirt and he tells everyone that it might work. So I guess that's a good start."
p232
aS"bitcoin community in the country or in my town is quite a lot, and I saw it online. but indeed when I look in real it is still rare. but I'm sure if some stores give logos accept bitcoin payments. very likely to be a lot of people using bitcoin as a means of payment, and even people who previously did not know about bitcoin, they'll try to find out about bitcoin, because I think by using bitcoin transactions are so many benefits and conveniences."
p233
aS'I think its not a good way to promote qr codes in t-shirt is not enough i think it needs more promotion about bitcoin like advertising it in facebook.. '
p234
aS'As quoted by above mate social networking websites help in big promotion of bitcoin. Also at the same time it reaches people in a very short time. This might cause an increased adoption in a less time which might grab the attention of governments which is not good for the growth.'
p235
aS"Tell them the uniqueness of Bitcoin Currency. Tell them what bitcoin is all about. Tell them the Pro's. If you want to encourage people to accept/use Bitcoin, then you have to tell something good about using Bitcoin and not the Bad things. You can also give them some evidence that bitcoin is good and you are using it. You can also tell the bad things about bitcoin but not too much. And tell them that bitcoin is growing. "
p236
aS'Nice topic if you want to encourage people to accept bitcoin for there business i think you must talk and teach him how to used it. Or open bitcoin in your places go to your mayor and suggest that bitcoin can use as payment to local business because bitcoin is easy to used.'
p237
aS'Local Businesses I might say will take some time to accept BTC. As they are not familiar with BTC and also paper money is always in need. Also there is and issue about internet connection. In order to transact wallet to wallet both person must have internet in order to confirm that the other one receive the BTC. When BTC will be accepted by big companies maybe its time for the local businesses.'
p238
aS'I think one of the ways to let people know about it is through schools. Since most of the household in the neighborhood has students then may be you can hold a seminar in those schools. Talk about the advantages of bitcoin and how it can help them and potentially profit from it when they use it. Then supplement some videos or notes for further understanding. \xc2\xa0You can also implement a business wherein you accept bitcoin as payment and some freebies or promos may be when they use it because people are willing to try something new when they wanted to get something for free or for a discount. If at first your customers pay you cash, give them some flyers about bitcoin so that the next time they come back and pay you they are already aware of it.'
p239
aS'Well, it depends on you, if you are the boss of your business that way, it would be very easy, you just need to teach your subordinates about bitcoin and how it works, then pay them with bitcoin, and bitcoin make them produce for you. if you make a good strategy for your business, I think it would be very easy'
p240
aS'i think that you should tell base things like how it is easy to send payment and how it is easy is to get payment, and i am sure that they will be interested'
p241
aS"I think this is not a solution. Because BTC wallets can send Bitcoin directly to other BTC wallets so I dont know why money senders needs BTC for there businesses? In fact BTC's convenience can weaken their sales"
p242
aS'In a few years, when there are a few million people use the bitcoin, the bitcoin price will be many times more.'
p243
aS'I always round up when paying with btc. I think an extra few cents/dollars on top of the bill is always a good experience for the business,\xc2\xa0 and doubly so if the price rises afterwards. '
p244
aS'For now i think many bitcoin users and traders and devs are planning how to adopt bitcoin more to accept almost all countries locally in many stores.. So better to wait for now.. and see what will happen in the future.. and im thinking it will happen in the future..\xc2\xa0 like in brazil..'
p245
aS'Before telling him what btc is ,you should him the price graph.Tell him about its unstable price nature and how much he can earn profit.'
p246
aS'That could be right. Although the bitcoin price is volatile, the price will rise in the long term. So if you hold long, you will make money.'
p247
aS"This is not a good idea at all. you can convince the sender to use bitcoin, but what if the receiver don't have the features of bitcoin? and only sending and receiving is not enough for local business, they send in fiat because fiat can be use easily in locally also. and bitcoin can't be used easily. if you accept bitcoin you again need to exchange them into fiat to use them and spend them."
p248
aS"It's going to be hard to convince local businesses to accept Bitcoins specially if they are not connected online. While everyone in this forum is dreaming that there will be a time for Bitcoins to accepted and go main stream like Paypal there are still people out there who does not appreciate Bitcoin and it's features. The confirmation alone is already a hassle to the local businesses, sometimes 1 confirmation can take up to 5 or more hours."
p249
aS'If the local business accepts the bitcoin and hold the bitcoin for a few hours, that will increase the bitcoin value.'
p250
aS'a slight advantage I think is enough, because if stored too long I fear of not liking'
p251
aS'Show the business low fees and ease of it. Maybe it will work but if there not so many to use the btc qr codes maybe not. But to have the option is nice. The owner will only need qr code so very cheap and easy. '
p252
aS'Using bitcoin for purchases encourages mainstream adoption and will thusly contribute to the value of your long term holdings as well. If more businesses had the ability to accept bitcoin, it might encourage consumers to start obtaining and spending it.'
p253
aS'And say goodbye now to an active price volatility of bitcoin since regular usage will lead to a strong currency. That is a great step for bitcoin and I like bitcoin to become a strong one by using it as a currency and not for investment purposes.'
p254
aS'I think, it is rather encouraging when I can explain them what advantages they have in case they include BTC in their plans. No matter how cool invention BTC is while it has no use in a business plan. Anyone who demonstrates BTC to a business should emphasize the factors that can really help in the businesses strategy. If you could not find any factor that would well help the business, maybe the business should not accept BTC. However, I can imagine several cases when a business meet with some problem that the advances of BTC could easily solve. In these cases, the chance is very good to demonstrate the advantages of BTC.'
p255
aS'Agree and most of local businesses are dealing almost with fiat transactions with their products and partnered merchants so accepting bitcoin can give them less profits. They will not hold bitcoin if ever they will accept bitcoin. They will use it again so the price fluctuations in bitcoin will not give them good profits.'
p256
aS'Well the receiver can always have the solution to create a btc wallet its free and easy and you will instantly get an btc address . Also Exhanging it to Fiat is also not a problems. As many of the btc walket has a option to diractly move btc into your bank account automatically converting it to fiat. '
p257
aS'I think merchant find it hard to actually integrate bitcoin in their cash flow. Remember not everybody is technical and when you accept bitcoin, basic knowledge is required.Overall I do think that bitcoin will become accepted globally but it is all a matter of time. When it happens, banks will shake out of fear.'
p258
aS'I also think BTC will become globally more known and accepted by businesses, but I have my doubts that banks will shake out of fear. Banks have the technical knowledge, necessary funds and true interest in adapting BTC instead. They will be among the biggest investors. Especially due to the growing ransomware threat.'
p259
aS"We're missing one importand aspect here. It's the legality of bitcoin. How can a local business accept btc of its illegal in the first place. Some countrie prohibit the transactiom of btc thats the one of the big reasons whys it can't grow locally. "
p260
aS'Actually it is needed an increased adoption of bitcoin as a more popular payment method between Internet users to increase the interest of stores to accept this coin. I think we need to be patient because this process is gradual and still will take more years.'
p261
aS'The good we do introduce it to people who do not yet know . Teach them how to use it and explain to them that bitcoin is a very fast way of payment . We should teach them step by step how to use it and how they can be converted into cash . The principle should be that many of them can be put to the bitcoin .'
p262
aS'The process is obviously gradual and would take time but it is not a bad idea if something introduces bitcoin to his local retailers to accept bitcoin and they would surely do it if they understand the advantages of it and if they accept it then more and more local people will come to know about it and that gradual change would be good for bitcoin.'
p263
aS'Yup we should also think about the countries that is not accepting bicoin as payment because of legality of it we know that in our country we are free on using bitcoin because its okay with our government but if we implement or if we encourage the local business to accept bitcoin as a payment then it would happen only in our country.'
p264
aS'In a few years, when there are a few million people use the bitcoin, the bitcoin price will be many times more. But that might not happen if the bitcoin does not innovate any more.'
p265
aS'Process is gradual but the introducing bitcoin to retails is first and the most important step in encouraging business to accept BTC.'
p266
aS'That is really the hardest part of letting the local businesses to accept bitcoin is by introducing it to them. I think you must need to do some presentation and proper introduction for them to let them use bitcoin. And it is going to be good if you are the one to do that, because you can ask them to have your shares for it.'
p267
aS'There are already a few or more million people using bitcoin worldwide so later on they will be counted in billions, and when the community reaches that point the adoption level would highly rise as well and the price would always follow the level of adoption.'
p268
aS'The better option which is not possible is to provide some promotions for local businesses. For example providing some goods cheaper than real price, if deals can be done using bitcoin.'
p269
aS'The main problem is how to present a good and simply understandable sentence about bitcoin to common people. Then create a good presentation I agree with you , explain how bitcoin prospects, benefits and the other things related to bitcoin features. Honestly this is easy said than done, bitcoin community in local area is not grow faster, useless if there is no customers. '
p270
aS'You can compare the total of the people in the world and the total of bitcoin users maybe you will knowing the answer, because until this time bitcoin just absorbing some percentage of the total people in the world.'
p271
aS'it is not that easy as you said. it needs a lot of planing and need team work, I can teach some peoples in my family or my street (same everyone can do) but we cannot change the overall situation.. using bitcoin is very easy but only at the web,but when it comes to local businesses the situaiton will get change completely.. and it can be only possible if big companies get involved in it to promote bitcoin in local businesses,'
p272
aS'one of the difficulties in accepting bitcoin bitcoin is a delivery time that requires confirmation. honest, maybe some people do not easily believe in using bitcoin. there must be new standards governing the delivery fee in order to become faster delivery bitcoin.'
p273
aS"I don't think that is a difficulty in bitcoin because it only takes few minutes for a transaction to get confirmation and I don't get a problem with it. And for sure the local businesses are not going to think about it either you just need to explain to them on how that confirmation works. And don't tell them that it is going to be a problem."
p274
aS"Confirmation time is just fine and merchants can deal with that.The one thing they can't deal is the price volatility in bitcoin. They want a price stable if ever they will accept bitcoin as payment method. To cover the risk they will just add some fees whenever there is a bitcoin transaction in their products."
p275
aS"That's right, the unstable price can be a problem for larger businesses because they would probably need to store a lot of funds in their business and while they are holding the funds and the price drops then they would probably pick up quite large losses and that is not something a business can afford."
p276
aS'In my opinion the best thing is making them acknowledge that it would be profitable for them to accept Bitcoin in their shops. Introducing them personally to the "Bitcoin world" would be the best but it is really time-consuming. A good thing would be spending some money into stamping leaflets and give them to the shop owners.'
p277
aS"Most of the businessman almost has no time to think about other currencies and it's effect to their business... I think it won't be easy to convince them, except if one of their partners or they themselves already have an experience with bitcoin... Coz if they don't have, perhaps they will always think about the price, it keeps on moving and they are not into trading their money coz that's another form of business to them, that's another thing to focus at.... "
p278
aS'i think you need to let them know how maay people wants to use bitcoins so i think they should think about letting buyers pay in bitcoins, also tell how it is easy to do that'
p279
aS"I also would like to add the issue about the concern for local business accepting bitcoin as what will they right on their income statement for the issuance of their tax? For example as a citizen of a country that don't accept btc don't you think it will be fishy for the government that they always have 0$ in their income statement yet the business is still open until now. "
p280
aS'Yeah I think you are right. As we use bitcoin in daily business It will produce false case in income tax statement and for that government should accepts the bitcoin as payment and they should centralised that, Till that it will not work at all. '
p281
aS"I think this is indeed quite bad at risk if there is no penindakan firmly against the Government, because if the Government didn't response upon this then surely the Government will become a loss and they lose the opportunity to earn a good enough profit to build his country. Using bitcoin payments more secure and comfortable than anything else, but the impact of this on the usage will now be bad for Government"
p282
aS'You guys are right that local businesses cannot accept bitcoin unless bitcoin accepts it as the taxes that are applied for using dollars wont be there if someone is using bitcoin because it is not controlled by the government so there would be no taxes and if the government finds that they can possibly ban that business.'
p283
aS'You know we are already doing online business like trading and investment, and thats all are accepted bitcoins, and we have no problem in it, so it has clear mean that we are encouraging the bitcoins, but in high level it takes sometime. But bitcoin is already going fast so may be within 10 years bitcoin also achieved more levels.'
p284
aS"If we are talking about trading and investment so that all are kinds of business, and really we can use bitcoin in it, and faces the no problem. But in pure business i don't think that we can use bitcoin easily. Because in official level and also in government level have many problems, and also it is a time taking work."
p285
aS'This seems like the most logical way. I think it also needs alot of time, people need time to ease into things especially if money is involved.'
p286
aS'we should show them how the bitcoin works. we have to prove its existence and the big question ia that bitcoin price is so voilent'
p287
aS"It really take more time to work with it, but if government will see the benifits and potential of this coin provably they will take the advantages of it and adopt its usefullness, and maybe that could be a trigger for business sector to accept bitcoin in their business venture,\xc2\xa0 and also if business man will also see the numbers of bitcoin users in the world well theirs a big provabilities that shops will totally accept bitcoins but as i've seen it nowadays their are numerous stores are currently accepting bitcoins nowadays and maybe in this upcoming future bitcoin shop acceptance will spread more and more. "
p288
aS'Nothing can happen by just showing them how bitcoin works or its existence until the government of that country gives freedom to everyone for using bitcoin because without permission no business can adopt any new currency just like that.'
p289
aS"The problem is not many people know about bitcoin, especially in my country. So, if a shop accepted bitcoin, it's like a useless move. Because nobody in my area using bitcoin."
p290
aS'Maybe we encourage them easily if we encourage first our local government to use or accept bitcoin in local businesses. Because if we direct to tell them maybe they can not believe on us. But if we explain in government how use it and teach them how to transfer in easy way maybe they can publish it to our area that bitcoin can use in local business.'
p291
aS'If the governments is wanna think for making a news about allowing for using bitcoin i think a lot of store and people will want to learning about bitcoin and that like in Russian cases.'
p292
aS"Always ask if you can pay by bitcoin, if they dont know what it is you can explain the concept or they'll look it up themselves cause they will be curious. If alot of people ask at one place then they will probably implent it as they don't want to miss out on money and want to keep customer satisfaction high."
p293
aS'Explaining is not enough. Business is business and they have to run it properly everyday. Until there is a massive request of people to those merchants to accept bitcoin, merchants will never considered to study the risk if they will have to accept bitcoin as payment method.But honestly, if bitcoin price become stable like fiat currencies, no need for such explaining as they will automatically add it in one of their payment method.'
p294
aS'I think firstly we have to tell\xc2\xa0 them what is bitcoin and what they can have advantage\xc2\xa0 if they can use bitcoin for\xc2\xa0 their businesses\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 , they will understand and they will see to use bitcoin for the thier\xc2\xa0 business and\xc2\xa0 they will except it , because if they see there is opportunities for they work , they will like to use bitcoin.'
p295
aS'Maybe in my experience as businessman I have facebook page and website and my businessaccept bitcoin payment its a small business. So I think if you endorse bitcoin by this method and your business grow. Local business study your business and you can lecture them about bitcoin currency. So therefore I think they copy your business plan and soon business in your area accept bitcoin payments also.'
p296
aS"Until the country's government does not recognize btc as sort of a 2nd currency of the country, Local Businesses wouldn't dare to consider BTC as a mode of payment. However they do have the option too convert it to Fiat for the sake of transparency. But then again the government will really gonna be on your back with all your transactions."
p297
aS"They cannot use it in the first place if the government of that country haven't announced bitcoin as a legal currency for that country, and if they do it without that it may be considered illegal and they might get charged so they would always have this fear in minds when they think about accepting bitcoin as a payment."
p298
aS"No need for recognization of bitcoin as sort of 2nd currency. Why in other places there are physical stores that accept bitcoin eventhough bitcoin is not their second currency to be consider as a whole?It's because of massive request and demands by the customers or maybe they just trying out if accepting bitcoin will be convenient if they did. It's like a beta tesing."
p299
aS'Yes you are right just thinking about it we need a hard work plan before we introduce it in many businesses. Bitcoin is easy to use in web and i think the big companies their no time to do it so encourage local business to use bitcoin is not easy. Maybe do they own research if bitcoin become popular in all country.'
p300
aS'The infrastructure of the bitcoin payment is not fully built yet, so the shops accepting the bitcoin is still very few.'
p301
aS'Its because the market and the bitcoins user are not totally wide and only few people around the globe are using this coin so thats why maybe thats the other reason why we see only few merchant are accepting bitcoins for now, but maybe in future if bitcoin craze will spread wider and will reach also to those not techy people and spread for more i think this massive adoption will gonna be grab by those merchant who follows bitcoin for now.'
p302
aS"Encourage them by giving them information. The first step is for them to know what bitcoin is all about.Then you'd have to prove or show that there's alot of people willing to use it in the shop, this will show the owners that adding this payment method will increase customer satisfaction and bring in more customers."
p303
aS"What if the government of that country haven't give permission to the citizens for using bitcoins? The things you are saying are absolutely right but they can be applied once the government announces that bitcoin is free to be used in the country so then you can convince a shopkeeper or a market owner with those words, otherwise it is not possible."
p304
aS"Yes and first we have to wait for the btc to be stable or steadily rising so they don't see the negative side of losing their money cause it drops quite often. Also we need alot of people using btc for it to be worth it to them. They will not put up a payment method just for it to be using once a month."
p305
aS'More promotion material and more information about bitcoin is the key. Let people learn about bitcoin themself and they will be sold eventually. The same thing happened to me.'
p306
aS'you basically have to explain to them how bitcoin works, what are the benefits and the cons of it. Base on my experience i personally introduce it to one of my friend that has a business and during that time my knowledge was really not enough to explain it to him so it just end up to no deal situation.'
p307
aS'encourage them by not selling bitcoin everytime it is at super high point this causes prices to be so unstable merching with the bitcoin and that scares off shop owners and also alot of them dont know anything about bitcoin so more bitcoin education and information and publicity would be a good start too not just for shop owners also for just customers cause they dont even have it most of the time.'
p308
aS'Understanding bitcoin for someone who is not connected to internet or technology much is actually to hard because i tried it myself to make some people understand it but they might it too complex.'
p309
aS'I would say that we can encourage them that with this type of method they can save a lot of effort and time if they are going to accept bitcoins as payment.But we need to consider first in the place if there are already users of bitcoin because that is not going to help if there are few users only.'
p310
aS"The problem is even the local businesses accepting bitcoin, not all people using bitcoin even in my country it's like no one using bitcoin except me. So, i think it's like a bit useless if the local busines accept bitcoin but the people not use bitcoin."
p311
aS"If we can make the bitcoin better we can already accomplish this most likely, the bitcoin needs to get more popular and than company's will automatically will accept the bitcoin.Another thing we could do is explain why they have to use the bitcoin and this is simply because they can make profit with it if the bitcoin market is going up."
p312
aS"It will turn complicated if you teach them without supporting facts,articles,video or even social media groups related to bitcoin and if you have those mentioned present when you teaching someone i will be sure that they will understand bitcoin slowly, so better don't giveup\xc2\xa0 to the people you teaching to used it because it maybe usefull in the future since it can make the market for bitcoin go spread for more."
p313
aS"well you're actually could just use an explanation video that available on youtube so they will know it and i guess the video could explain better than us because that video was made with effort and being planned perfectly,sometimes if we explain to another people,they'll can't know what we're talking about due to different thinking"
p314
aS'I think when trying to encourage a local business owner or even anyone to accept BTC as a mode of payment, you shouldn\'t jump to persuading them. Don\'t be like "Bitcoin is amazing, accept bitcoin now in your shop." Even if you\'re able to get into the mind of the shop owner and make him such a ditto head, if he don\'t understand how the whole Bitcoin concept works, then he shouldn\'t accept BTC.First, you have to lecture him about how a wallet works, how to make his wallet secure, what is Bitcoin, what is the advantage and disadvantage of Bitcoin, stuffs like that. When he fully understand all of those, he can then decide if it\'ll be beneficial to him and to his shop if he accept BTC or not.'
p315
aS'It is really hard for a local store to accept bitcoin if there are only few bitcoin users in that place. But that is still going to be an advantage.Because you are just the only one store that is going to accept bitcoin, what you need to do now is to market bitcoin and introduce it to the people.Once you have done that you are going to start out to run your business properly with bitcoin.'
p316
aS'Yup if they try in overseas trade in the international business means it would spread among most of people and then if we have initializing mini Ecommerce or direct business which accepts with bitcoin means that will be good. '
p317
aS'We need to tell them how good bitcoin is'
p318
aS'In one word education, those business owners need to realize that they are losing a piece of the action, so we must show them not only what bitcoin is, but how it can benefit them'
p319
aS'to encourage them we need to have more people use it no? cause its all about what the customers want and if alot of customers want to pay with bitcoin i dont think a company wants to miss out money on that. So the plan would be to show them in a way that theres alot of people asking for this.'
p320
aS"Local stores are not meant to hold bitcoins that's why in the first place they aren't considering to accept it as one of their preferred payment method.All of their products and services are mostly deals with fiat transactions so it's a risk for them to accept bitcoin. Even they have to accept bitcoin they will spend it quickly to circulate all products in the market."
p321
aS"I think that it's not something serious problems for those who really understand about the bitcoin > because I see that the easier bitcoin owner and lovers online store shop online in any transactions made. They don't need to wait for confirmation of a lingering funding and also the owner can directly benefit 2 x/more (If knowing well the workings of the bitcoin)"
p322
aS'I also think this is the point, its a risk because its not a currency that is stable or something and that we can use easily these days.It first needs to get a lot more popular before shops can even accept it because not a lot of people are paying with it these days.'
p323
aS'The fluctuation is actually the biggest reason that can stop a place to accept bitcoin as a payment because what would they do with the bitcoins if the price drops suddenly to come dollars? They would probably lose a lot of money as they cannot just exchange them as they earn them by selling something they would probably have a scheduled time for exchanging.'
p324
aS"We don't need to do nothing, bitcoin is going to grow, and little by little to take piece's of the global market. When it prove itself on global plan, for bitcoin will be much easier to get into local areas. Thing is that world work on that way, and things happened in that order. For now just people who believe enough in btc will risk to try some businesses, but as it well known early adopter's made good money, except of thinking about other businesses, we need to open ours and try to be early adopter's in our towns, villages, cities."
p325
aS'My country does not like the idea of coins that float in thin air (think about ether)\xc2\xa0 I tried to teach them about e-currency and their response was "Sir, Do you really want to buy anything or are you wasting our time??". Fiat is ruling here and to be honest I like it. I still can secure my bank wallet let alone my private keys\xc2\xa0  '
p326
aS'True, bitcoin isnt popular all over the world and even some countries didnt even heard about bitcoin. Its a little bit\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0hard to convince a certain person or merchant to accept bitcoin on their businesses because they would surely refuse because they didnt even\xc2\xa0 bitcoin yet. If adoption on bitcoin would\xc2\xa0 be already progressive on a certain country then it might possible.'
p327
aS'Many places are like that yet as bitcoin was never properly introduced to them like fiat, fiat has been running from centuries so now suddenly they cannot turn their faces to something else and stop using fiat at once, they would probably need some time to adopt bitcoin.'
p328
aS'I think we just keep on using bitcoin and this is already a kind of support for this program. If we do continue to grow then it may be way for those investors to settle down and think if it is really worth it to invest into crypto currency since the community is getting wider and the opportunity of gaining profit is really enough.'
p329
aS"Firstly bitcoin is not much popular which means that there will not be much transaction in bitcoin.And if they don't have any profit they wouldn't start so I will not encourage them now but after a year."
p330
aS'Tell them that it is very easy for customers to pay for something'
p331
aS'but actually they can get a profit with this if they target the market of bitcoin users and also it can give them great impact and exposure since only few merchant for now are accepting this coin, so if they will grab this oppurtunity well they can possibly get an free advertisement since their name will be stick to bitcoins fame if they accepted it, so thats why i think its win-win situation for online business sector to accept bitcoin since bitcoin craze are spreading globally.'
p332
aS'We can encourage local businesses to accept BTC by educating them about the pros and cons of bitcoin. The only thing that I can see that is troublesome is the setting up of an address to end the bitcoin to. But we could always use a bitcoin debit card .'
p333
aS'It isnt that easy to encourage them. People dont trust each other. If I introduce them a new kind of money which floats in thin air, then think I am trying to scam them. They are more interested in fiat - why? because fiat is accepted everywhere and can be exchanged everywhere. They are running businesses they know how to make deals and stay away from volatile currencies. The acceptance of bitcoin in my country is an absolute nil.'
p334
aS'I agree with you encouraging local businesses to accept bitcoin is not going to be an easy task to do. It is just like you are going to propose to them so that you are going to able to encourage them in formal way. You must do some presentation just for them to be able to convince in using bitcoin.'
p335
aS'Encourigng local businesses to accept btc is a difficult thing to do as a one man army. To do this we have to let the business owners know that alot of people are prepared to pay with BTC and we have to show them the benefits of having low fees next to none etc. Maybe like this.'
p336
aS'It requires a lot of process besides encouraging them as they will face problems such as converting btc to fiat money, your wallet account verification, also price volatility of btc compared to fat money. Some of which can discourage local businesses in accepting BTC.'
p337
aS"I encouraged my local bakery to use it and now they do! I printed alot of info for them and showed them how much people use it and how it's not much effort for them to accept it and now they do so I think you just have to approach them and ask!"
p338
aS'All they want to see the local businesses is interest. If they see interested in a certain something then they see cash. For example with the pokemongo all the bars and restaurants started to profit from that. We can do the same with bitcoin we just have to go even more viral in the world of non tech people.'
p339
aS'While this is correct bitcoin does not have the appeal of Pok\xc3\xa9mon go, bitcoin is not a game is serious business so I think that while you say is correct about encouraging those business by showing them that accepting bitcoin is on their best interest, we cannot use the same strategy as Pok\xc3\xa9mon go.'
p340
aS"Initially understanding about the digital currency as well it's alternates is a must for bitcoin acceptance on local businesses. Without understanding it implementing surely gets ended in loss. Better is to start on small scale trades and move on."
p341
aS"There is win-win situation but not always, they should hire someone to maintain the bitcoin wallets, transactions and other stuff related to bitcoin and money.They got mentioned in popular crypto news and it's true that they will get our support but the starting is the hardest."
p342
aS"Yes the big problem not question is that the price is so volatile and all over the place, this is not assuring at all for any company so they wouldn't want to adopt it.As the price gets more stable we can start to encourage them, they'd like the idea more and would see the benefits over the cons that bitcoin has."
p343
aS'Yes exactly first of all they have to improve the technology and keep improving. After that there has to be more advertising about bitcoin to get more people using it. Then also a requirement I think is to have a stable price. Stable prices or prices which only go up are very attractive to a business.'
p344
aS'The company is considering, about the volatility of the price their the value of their product can decreasing for instantly and that is very bad for them maybe just waiting about if there are a tool can controlling or matching the price of the stuff and rate in the market for instantly maybe a lot of them will encourage bitcoin.'
p345
aS"This is true, we should first establish the basic understanding of people about bitcoin.\xc2\xa0 While making them understand bitcoin we should emphasize the\xc2\xa0 strenght of and features of bitcoin that can be use for everyone's benefit. We don't need to defame the current financial system, doing so will just annoy some of the people.\xc2\xa0 We should at least tell\xc2\xa0 them how bitcoin and fiat money coexist and at the same time can tell them the potential earnings\xc2\xa0 using both."
p346
aS"volatility of the price could be resolved by using bitcoin payment API that exchange the bitcoin equivalent amount to dollar directly when the bitcoin just received and being confirmed so there's no point worrying about volatility unless you're not using the API"
p347
aS"We can encourage local businesses by putting less pressure and showing more results. Showing results of the growth of bitcoin and how many people us it.Once they see that they will decide by themselves that's it's a good move to implement bitcoin into their business as payment method."
p348
aS'Thats right because no matter how volatile of the bitcoins price when you use API the conversion would be still the same and it equals to the\xc2\xa0 value\xc2\xa0 in dollar rate. If\xc2\xa0 any company would use it then there would be\xc2\xa0 no hindrance about price movements.'
p349
aS'There are lots of approach on how to encourage local businesses to accept bitcoin but the first move should be educating them.\xc2\xa0 You cannot just barge in and offer stuff and tell them use BTC or adopt BTC you will earn plenty using this.\xc2\xa0 This kind of approach open ended in a bad thing.\xc2\xa0 Simply by being consistent with educating people with bitcoin, showing possible venture they can do with bitcoin,\xc2\xa0 and telling the advantage without criticizing the current financial system.\xc2\xa0 This way we can earn the local business trust and may probably open their minds and heart to new venture with bitcoin.'
p350
aS'Its depends of there business honestly business is always looking for more impressions if they service or business is not fit for bitcoins i think they can not accept bitcoin but they can try for the first time so that they know if it will work for their business or not..'
p351
aS'I think we can encourage local businesses by setting an example.\xc2\xa0 Instead of suggesting them to put up a merchant store for bitcoin, why not , if we have fund, put up a merchant store ourselves.\xc2\xa0 if we prove to them that it is very profitable using bitcoin\xc2\xa0 then they will automatically inquire about the new technology and then setup their own bitcoin accepting stores.'
p352
aS'If you holding bitcoins we i think we are starting business just holding bitcoins.. so if we offer bitcoins in any company they should accept it to increase their leads or sales.. because many people right now are using bitcoins.'
p353
aS'To show the business owners the pros of bitcoin without polarizing the topic is a good idea, I think but business owners care the most about a single thing, profit, right now I don\xc2\x92t think there is enough persons using bitcoin at the moment.'
p354
aS'Yes this is the number one problem alot more people have to know about bitcoin for bussinesses to accept them because if nobody uses them anyways why would they do the effort to implement them and learn about them. First get mass adopted then more stores accept.'
p355
aS'One of the strategy to let local businesses around your area get to adopt bitcoin is to present and introduce this to the one\'s who are definitely active in using the current technology.\xc2\xa0 Because they are the one\'s who is gonna demand for its market usage.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It is like inquiring to any establishment if "Do you accept bitcoins here?"\xc2\xa0 So if the demand goes higher then the local businesses will find ways to address the payment mode of the costumer.\xc2\xa0 So if possible you have to educate both.'
p356
aS"well i should agree that it's such a useless move by implementing bitcoin as payment option when it's not really popular among people nearby the shop but if the shop just selling their stuffs online then bitcoin could be a little bit more useful because as you know,by selling online the shop could cover way wider buyers than only having offline shop so it's actually not a useless move"
p357
aS'You can encourage your local business to accept BTC if you go to educate them about it. Also I agree with people maybe just not enough people use it or show that they use it. The business owners have to see the interest in bitcoin with their own eyes.'
p358
aS"To encourage local businesses we have to encourage more people to use bitcoin. Why would shops do effort for it if they don't know what it is and people don't use it. Get it more well known, more used by people ( cause most just keep their money in btc wallet) and also educate the businesses about bitcoin."
p359
aS"local business don't need you to educate them because they will learn about bitcoin if it's popular around them,they need people to buy their goods and whatever the payment option they really don't care as long they can make profit,they will use it whatever it's about"
p360
aS"Don't encourage them just let them decide by themselves with no pressure. We have to get bitcoin more known trough commercials etc.If they see it trough ads they will look it up by their free will and they will see all the benefits and people using it so it will be very attractive."
p361
aS"Also it's impossible for a local business not to study the risk of accepting bitcoin as one of their payment option so educating them isn't necessary.As long as bitcoin price has an active fluctuations, I understand those local business that still not accepting bitcoin. They are here to profit on daily basis and not to hold coins and wait for the price increase."
p362
aS'To encourage local businesses to accept Bitcoin you have to let them know the advantages and disadvantages behind Bitcoin. Also teaching them how to manage Bitcoin.   '
p363
aS"I don't know how much your assumption will work, I think we need to tell that they can use bitcoin while they were doing trade their stock. Instead fiat cash they can bitcoins for to reduce energy the fees. If they need to international transfer even that time also business people can use this bitcoin. "
p364
aS'Maybe caused using bitcoin can reducing the total of fees but that\'s will need for reserving more time for every transaction if we are wanna for making any compare, i will more prefer for choosing the time is will be more faster than reducing the fees. "time is money"'
p365
aS'There should be some kind of TV ads to let most of the people in the world know about the bitcoin. But who will pay?'
p366
aS"Encouraging local business to accept btc is not really in our hands but more into the hands of bitcoin and how they get into the media.If they have positive feedback in the media this will allow them to grow more and shops to pick them up too. Negative news = shops won't want it."
p367
aS"To encourage them you have to tell them what they get out of it. Low fees etc all the good attractive stuff.But to say this to every shop is alot of work, we need mass advertisement and commercials and then I'd promise it will get super big super fast."
p368
aS"But bitcoin networks need conformation(i don't know why) thats why we cannot really tell that transaction to people will be faster enough from using this coin but i think if local business nor online will accept this it can give their more convinient since bitcoins cannot be reversable and also fees are much more lesser unlike to any other processor out there. And i am agreeinh for you to say time is money but we cant controll the bitcoins confirmation."
p369
aS"when the BTC was spread in the whole world,it's more bussniess will accept it"
p370
aS"the confirmation needed in order to prevent double spend,so people can't spend their money twice when they actually could only spend it onceand the confirmation speed sometimes getting affected by how much fee you set up in your transaction if it's meet the requirement then your transaction will be confirmated fastly,even though there's also another factor"
p371
aS"It is indeed true, it is now already in a stage of growth bitcoin exactly who you are talking about. So this will give you a pretty good effect, if the market has given a very positive fedback for bitcoin. Something that is bad for us is couldn't help but lust and greed. So if we want to successfully hold the lust and greed also"
p372
aS"Yeah and I think to encourage them they need alot of information cause they won't take something which will harm business.It could be an idea to make a informative flyer and spread it around stores explaining bitcoin and giving a link to more information."
p373
aS"No it's not that we have to tell them the benefits of it. They have a research team which is far can surpass all our ideas about bitcoin if they wil make some priorty of study on it that can make some brainstorming and no needs for us to do it.As long as bitcoin has a large volatility we can't never really sees some more businesses that will accept bitcoin."
p374
aS'By reducing expenses for them if they start accepting BTC or giving them a bonus percent of your purchase.I think that will encourage them accept BTC'
p375
aS'How can you reduce expenses for the merchant? \xc2\xa0Unless you are a supplier, you can \xc2\xa0cut your profit and give discount to them. \xc2\xa0Or if you have lots of Bitcoin and sell this merchant discounted BTC or if they accept bitcoin, you buy them higher than the exchange. \xc2\xa0And remember, in setting up bitcoin payment, you need extra tools for it. \xc2\xa0You \xc2\xa0need internet, gadgets and it needs both the buyer and seller to be able to connect to the network and complete \xc2\xa0the transaction. \xc2\xa0there are great ideas but the problem is the fund to support it. \xc2\xa0Maybe we can start with bitcoin education drive.'
p376
aS'I think if governments take the decision to support Bitcoin and allow using it as payment processor, more local marketplaces and stores will start using it as well.'
p377
aS'We can encourage local businesses to accept btc by spreading information about btc because to use btc you have to know what it is first.When they know what it is they can decide if its worth it for the company to use it.'
p378
aS'Well,this has to be by the politicians,the governors,they have to reduce the expenses,but they have to be willing to make BTC a more popular means of payment'
p379
aS'It is all about proper impartation of or knowledge about bitcoin and we have to educate them very precisely on what are the benefits that they can get if theycarw going to use bitcoin as a payment'
p380
aS'Yeah and i think this is the most important area to improve asap on. Because once they start accepting then bitcoin will start to really blossom like it should but it cant yet because of this reason.'
p381
aS'before we introduce bitcon into people, i think we should give them an explaining about bitcoin and we can give them an example of how to using bitcoin and make any transaction with easy. it should need hard work and there is no one can do without other people. so maybe you can make little group with your friends which using bitcoin and start to make a community and make meeting discussion group and ask people to join, then in that meeting group you can tell them about bitcoin. its really need hard work to do this but after you success, then people in your city will appreciate to you and make bitcoin as payment soon.'
p382
aS'To educate about the bitcoin, that can be easily done in that here in forum itself. I would suggest you to adopt the bitcoin as payment in your business. That would only motive the people around you easily instead of educating. '
p383
aS'proper approach regarding to bitcoin potentials and easy to use payment system will let them be attracted to use this service, as bitcoin already been popular over the net you can inform them that this could be the next big thing in the future, give them idea that btc is also just like atm and credit cards.'
p384
aS'For me it is much easy, we should have to invite our friends and our relative for to use bitcoin and have to advise them to invite other peple also and when these people will use bitcoin then we will find some people to use bitcoin with, and after that it will get promote more and when we will need to buy any thing with bitcoin and we will not find them then we can ask them for exchange.'
p385
aS'We can encourage them by using more bitcoin overall and getting them more knowledge about bitcoin. For example if you know the shop owner you could just have a chat about bitcoin and what it can mean for him and his customers. They have to be educated about it.'
p386
aS"True we as users don't have that much power to make bitcoin more useable in stores. Cause we simply don't have the power for that.But if we would see more commercials invovling bitcoin businesses and more businesses which are focused around btc then it will get more popular by itself."
p387
aS"Encourage local businesses by asking them about bitcoin and if they will accept it in the future like this you'll get to know if they even know what bitcoin is.Most shop owners don't know bitcoin yet and they should cause it can be profitable for them, we need more publicity."
p388
aS'There are allot of big companys introducing bitcoins so maybe if they are seeing that smaller companys are also willing to introduce it only if the bigger companys making profits with it other wise they wont.'
p389
aS'Even if you teach them precisely and tell them every benefits or advantages or using bitcoin still they wont be able to use it as a payment system until the government of that county legalize it, because they would be afraid if the authorities come to know they might seal them for using it if it is not yet legalized.'
p390
aS"Asking them isn't enough and if there are only few queries about the concern then it will not be prioritized.As long as bitcoin have an unstable price, our suggestions and advices to the store owners will not be taken seriously."
p391
aS'Yeah asking them is not enough they are asking how bitcoin can help for their business and what is the use of bitcoin for their business i think this question. that we can get for the local company..'
p392
aS'Politicians and bankers don\xc2\x92t like bitcoin and we should never expect that to change, bitcoin will need to grow by itself without the aid of those two sectors.'
p393
aS"Encourage local businesses by showing them facts. If everybody keeps selling their bitcoin when the prices just raises by a little then bitcoin will never retain it's value.If the value is low then business owners are not interested to learn this concept and use it in practice."
p394
aS'Introduce them what bitcoin is and the advantage of using it in their business. its not going to be easy to encourage them especially if its not popular in the consumers. i think the easiest thing to do is gather some business owners and set a seminar to introduce them the benefits of having bitcoin.'
p395
aS"Maybe they don't like it for now but what if the market of bitcoin users will spread more and more? Do you think they will still hate it? And i really think they will come and join to build up some laws and business to grab those oppurtunities and benifits of this coin and maybe we can see some banks will accept if bitcoin user will be more and increasing daily so i think those two sector will get used to it if they see bitcoins great oppurtunities upon existence and they can help to market bitcoins aswell if they will join to."
p396
aS"Well its a very profitable market and there are no real fee's too so that is nice when you are accepting it if you are asking me.Another nice fact is that it can be used everywhere and that you can make profit with just holding it as a business."
p397
aS"It just wont happen at least not any time soon, there is no way right now for local business to accept bitcoin, it doesn't even make sense for them to do it, I don't really see any benefits for them, it's just extra trouble and work for no reason, they can easily lose money just with bitcoin volatility. "
p398
aS'I might don\'t understand the content of your post but you think local businesses will care for holding bitcoins? Again, "business". Their operation is on daily basis so money here is in and out. Also I don\'t see any nice fact about "it can be used everywhere".'
p399
aS'Bitcoin is not that popular as many people think it is. Some countries dont even have proper electricity and let alone internet connection. Moreover, e-commerce giants are few of those that accept bitcoin here and none of the local markets/shops/stores have ever heard of it. It very tough to get it accepted by everyone and I think the governments must work it.'
p400
aS"That's because they are not BTC enthusiasts,if they are they will be more than willing to accept BTC and even encourage people to pay with BTC"
p401
aS'This is one\xc2\xa0 of the reasons why\xc2\xa0 merchants\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0do have hindrance on\xc2\xa0 switching\xc2\xa0 bitcoin\xc2\xa0 as\xc2\xa0 a payment on their\xc2\xa0 goods and services and thats\xc2\xa0 because of\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0price volatility and also\xc2\xa0 some merchants\xc2\xa0 on other countries doesnt even heard\xc2\xa0 about bitcoin at all thats\xc2\xa0 why\xc2\xa0 bitcoins adoption on\xc2\xa0 merchants\xc2\xa0 is slowly progressing. Well maybe in future when bitcoin adoption\xc2\xa0 increases\xc2\xa0 and also the price would increase for sure\xc2\xa0 it would increase the\xc2\xa0 sum of merchants would\xc2\xa0 accept bitcoin as a payment.'
p402
aS"Besides volatility maybe there aren't enough people willing to use bitcoins for shopping around where a local business is running, just for a few people a market would never introduce a new system of payment, they would only think of it if they receive quite a lot of requests for such a thing and then they will see if it is legalized so they might adopt it."
p403
aS'I agree the initiative of these local businesses needed to become more encouraging by us. And we must tell them that bitcoin has the future cashless society.And if they are going to adopt it then they are going to have another way of getting paid for their business but I guess they are going to be scared because of its volatility.But if they are going to see it, they are going to see a lot of opportunity out of it.'
p404
aS'I dont think it is right time for that in my country. Probably look for a better time to introduce it to the local business, when the trade is easier and safer.'
p405
aS"And what do they win by accepting bitcoins? Imagine a restaurant that accepts bitcoin, one day they earn 12 bitcoins total, bitcoin is at 600$, imagine they don't exchange them immediately and tomorrow bitcoin goes down to 590, they lose 120$ just like that for no reason, why would that benefit them? "
p406
aS"I think they don't want to use bitcoins because it is still new so they are afraid. All you need to do is to tell them how good they are and how it is good to use them, and they should like it"
p407
aS'I support your opinion on irregularity in currency value. It is not good for daily transaction.'
p408
aS"I think they actually don't know how accepting BTC will benefit thema and therefore they aren't willing to try something new-that's why they should be encouraged and also that's why politicans should actually invole more BTC as a currency "
p409
aS"In fact, we are can't encourage the local business for accepting bitcoin and bitcoin is so far from an enough currency for getting a real implementation caused by their own disadvantages like what are you saying and the another factor like the confirmation is always needed by the merchant or seller for preventing about the doubled spend."
p410
aS'Why not local business accept bitcoins.. like brazil that has 150 stores locally that accept bitcoins?And i think in the future we will see that bitcoin will be use locally in the future the same as brazil.. this is just my speculation and i think it will happen the same as brazil..'
p411
aS'Bitcoin is already have a lot of quality, but one thing which we need it and that is publicity of bitcoin, we should have introduce the bitcoin in high level, than definitely it work and it encourage local business to accept the bitcoins, you know in local level bitcoin work more but it is not doing because lack of information about bitcoin, it is time taking a work but it will be work.'
p412
aS"And anyhow most business today are run by people who know nothing about bitcoin and although we try to make it look easy, it's not, you have to understand a little bit about bitcoins and how they work before you can even start thinking to implement them into your business, why would anyone take all that time just for that? Everyone has normal money so there is really no need to accept bitcoins, I'm not saying that accepting bitcoins would automatically make it worse for them or anything but you definitely have to know what you are doing in order to actually profit from it"
p413
aS"the trade is easy and safe. why do you think that this is not right time? I think this is the best time to introduce bitcoin to our family. our neighbours and our city's people.. because bitcoin price is still affordable to buy and to get invested in this.but after some more years bitcoin price may be way more high. and people can't afford to jump in bitcoin that time."
p414
aS'Yes they will hate it and reject it, bitcoin runs contrary to the political and banking system, even if they could grab great business opportunities that will not change, because they will grow more powerful in the world of bitcoin they will get a lot weaker in their original sectors, banking and politics.'
p415
aS'I did not encourage any local business owner, as yet, but talked to some close friends who want to send money abroad, explained that using bitcoin it would be cheaper and faster than using banks or Western Union/Moneygram services and convinced some of them to send this way.'
p416
aS"Too many the system in btc is can't be applied in the local business such as the confirmation, and that's will becomes a prevent things for the local business for encouraging bitcoin in this day."
p417
aS"Encourage local businesses by just using bitcoin and showing them it's actually a currency and it is being used.Cause if they don't see that it's globally used then it's no reason for them to add it to their payment methods ofcourse."
p418
aS"Indeed the main point of running is a business is to make profit right so what better to do then to show them there's profit laying in bitcoin. There's people using it and prefering the method, also there's no transaction fees which save money for them aswell."
p419
aS"Perhaps trying to spread more information is a good start. If you think about it there's not that much information about bitcoin without looking it up.It should be in your face commercials so more people get to know it and get interested."
p420
aS'Good idea and good for you, to be honest I haven thought of using bitcoin instead of western union, but it makes sense, since the tariffs offered by western union can be completely ridiculous.'
p421
aS"I don't think they would accept it just by seeing you using it as an individual because it can be profitable for someone using it individually but it cannot be the case if someone is adopting it without any other adoptions around because there might not be other users in that place using bitcoin beside you."
p422
aS"Encouraging local businesses is not a thing for users of bitcoin to do, it will feel more like pressure cause you just want to use it.They have to be informed via commercials for example and then they will find out about bitcoin and it's benefits."
p423
aS'That does not make much sense, who is going to pay for those commercial that you speak of? The investors, users of bitcoin, the developers, the exchanges?'
p424
aS'Well I guess that is not going to happen immediately because the investors and local stores needed to make sure that their investments and advertising is going to be worth it. One of the risk is that you are going to advertise and not having some research on how many people are already using bitcoins to your place. That is going to be a waste of money for them.'
p425
aS'Right now the most effective to expand the user base of bitcoin is not with expensive commercials but with old and proven word of mouth, with the current technology like social networks the old word of mouth has become even more effective.'
p426
aS'The commercials are supposed to be paid by the businesses accepting bitcoin because if they start doing business with bitcoin they would probably need bitcoin customers and for getting bitcoin customers they would probably need to promote their business combined with bitcoin.'
p427
aS'That is part of the risk when putting up some investment. Other companies with unique features in their product are like that, making up some great advertisements even an ad in a television. Others succeed but others don\'t. They don\'t know what will be the output of it to the viewers that\'s why they are testing it.If a local businesses merchants is really serious in accepting bitcoin, they will enter that risk of adverstising. Like I said, if "really serious".'
p428
aS'Commercials are good but local retailers have to have some kind of incentive as well if we want them to accept BTC'
p429
aS'Bitcoin could be the solution for small, local businesses, especialy for start ups and when there is luck of other ways of financing. But the problem is if they are placed in small communities where people are not very keen to accept and use Bitcoin, which is often the case, then their chances are not very big.'
p430
aS'Its not easy to encourage local business to accept btc but if its related in their product or they can know what bitcoin is exactly maybe they can accept bitcoins too. better to share to them how you earn in bitcoin..'
p431
aS'There are maybe some methods to let businesses accept the bitcoin, I think if you tell them about the fact that they can make profit with doing almost nothing some will step in without\xc2\xa0 doubts.'
p432
aS"Yes but i think the benefits are not big enough right now for them cause we don't see enough people actually using there bitcoin yet most people have it as a saving investment so spending it is taboo for them which is a big con for shop owners."
p433
aS'I guess that would work for an individual that they might earn profits without doing anything in bitcoin but that wont be the case for a business as a business wont be able to hold any funds like an individual but they will have to keep them rolling which might cause a loss for them when the price drops.'
p434
aS'Every person that know about bitcoin and has a shop will somehow try to accept bitcoin in their shop. So basically for us to encourage more people is to inform that about bitcoin.Tell them what bitcoin is and how they can make or implement it in their daily life and business.'
p435
aS"Thats why they're getting a hard time to accept bitcoin at their business since bitcoins flactuates fast and i think the price drop is the worst fear of those business owner he they wouldn't accept bitcon for now, remember they are not regular long time holder and bitcoins cannot be trusted to hold for that longer and many pennies will be loss for sudden dump, so acceptance for now is really hard to achieve and maybe lets wait for further news."
p436
aS"Right, as they as want for know bitcoin just causing by their intention and not from the another people's advice and that's will not giving them pressure and i agree with it, and especially they will wanna for learning bitcoin caused by their intention."
p437
aS"Bitcoin businesses however aren't that promoting masively the fact that they can just target small community like this forum. A lot of bitcoin businesses don't even advertise on adnetworks as having thier presence here in the forum is enough to get noticed by the users."
p438
aS'if you want find a bitcoin accepting shops in your local then tell your story of successful buisiness and earning in bitcoin . in this way local businesses and shop holder will take interest in your matter .'
p439
aS"Do you think owners will just hear to that kind of statement without demands from most of it's customers?If those owners really getting high and good profits out of their usual way then they will just hear the idea of accepting bitcoin but will not take serious of it."
p440
aS'We can encourage local businesses more to use bitcoin by telling them information about bitcoin but I also think we need more advertisement for bitcoin.The owner or creator of bitcoin should be advertising it more so more shops get to know the key information'
p441
aS"Yeah i don't think that owner will just jump in for some inspirational word without analyzing the consequences of things.\xc2\xa0 they need to have proof and solid feasibility study on how they can earn a profit from this kind of venture.\xc2\xa0 Only inexperience investors will just jump without having this knowledge of pros and cons of the thing they need to invest in or put up."
p442
aS'Are you joking ? I guess you are treating bitcoin similar to other altcoins ?But, it must be one of important responsibility for every bitcoiners here. We must spread out the awareness of bitcoin ecosystem by educating the advantages of adopting bitcoin payments to merchants and also to every human we know personally.'
p443
aS'We can encourage local businesses to accept btc by giving local businesses more information about bitcoin so they know the benefits.Also prices HAVE to stay stable before locals will even consider accepting it else it will not be worth it for them.'
p444
aS"Not the best way to go about. Tbh there isn't any big advantage of accepting bitcoins, except for just offering the customers an extra choice or method to pay with. As for your second point, prices don't have to be stable. They can sign up for something like bitpay which allows the money to be transferred to their bank accounts directly, while allowing customers to pay with bitcoin. "
p445
aS'Stable price would be a curse for bitcoin users as if the price of bitcoins starts being stable no one would be able to earn profits by holding their coins while almost every bitcoin users has holding right now, so if the price starts being stable there would be less investments in bitcoin.'
p446
aS'For me it seems that business are like consumers and they want something. If bitcoin becomes more popular they will more likely start informing themself about itcoin.That could be the start of a new era.'
p447
aS"Yes you are right, if It be looked from viewpoint as traders but bitcoin's high fluctuation will become scary, for users who use bitcoins for transaction daily on real life are like local stores. They never use bitcoins for payment method on their local business."
p448
aS'Right now I don\xc2\x92t think there\xc2\x92s is much that we can do in order to encourage adoption, adoption should be organic that way the growth will be a real growth on the user base of bitcoin and not some kind of fad.'
p449
aS'But unless the business is bitcoin related then bitcoin will not get a lot of exposure as it will be mentioned in passing with the other payment methods accepted in the business.'
p450
aS'Thats actually right, if the business is not bitcoin related then it might get customers but bitcoin wont get much out of that because that would only be a success for that particular business but nothing good for bitcoin, in terms of bitcoin to get something out of it the business must be related to bitcoin somehow, just payments in bitcoin wont make a big difference.'
p451
aS"Yes its because they would surely select their markets and if there are only few of their neighbors or possible prospect are using this coin i don't think they would accept bitcoins for that scenario, so we can't convinced them literaly if their people are not bitcoin users, so for now i think bitcoins need to grow for mor first and make a great noise so it will reach to those people who doesn't know about it, and maybe if that happen we can really see the fast growing of business acceptance with bitcoins."
p452
aS'It can happen if the owners of local shops and markets are educated at least to know about to run computer and will have knowledge of English language. In my area most of shop keepers are uneducated and do not speak English language. so in my place only super markets can start bitcoin.'
p453
aS"I thought you did not need to push them. yeah I'm sure that one day many stores or local binsis will flock accept bitcoin. because they see the enthusiasm of many people using bitcoin, I'm sure sooner or later bitcoin will make them be interested. You do not need to force them to join"
p454
aS'its true because for now, i think many store will be attract to receive bitcoin as their payment and bitcoin is really makes customer payment with easy and less fee of transaction. we can see that there is a third party that integrated with store online and used bitcoin as payment.'
p455
aS'I think it is not\xc2\xa0 that easy.\xc2\xa0 There\xc2\xa0 are lots of things to consider.\xc2\xa0 Besides if\xc2\xa0 a shop is to implement\xc2\xa0 bitcoin,the owner of the shop\xc2\xa0 have to make sure that there is an internet access in his place, and had his net open to the customers, if\xc2\xa0 he needs to encrypt it and give password to the\xc2\xa0 user who wants to pay with bitcoin, it will sure delay the transaction.\xc2\xa0 Then they\xc2\xa0 need to scan send and wait for the confirmation.\xc2\xa0 we all know confirmation takes sometime and it is not practical for a store to make customer wait for 10 to 30\xc2\xa0 min to finish the transaction.'
p456
aS'Your success story or bitcoin earnings can only impress an individual to come towards bitcoin but the case is not the same with a business because in a business bitcoin wont be used as it is used by an individual, they cannot hold the coins nor they can be trading them on exchanges but they will just have to keep running their business with it which would need further considerations.'
p457
aS'There are only 2 types of business that have the muscle to do this exchanges and bitcoin casinos, but for them there is not a lot of reasons to do so, after all why spend\xc2\xa0 so much money in untargeted ads when they can obtain better results with targeted ads?'
p458
aS'I think in my own opinion, we are not in the position of encouraging them to accept bitcoin, it is the function of government to do that because I know that no business man will want to go against any government law and as LOCAL as they are, they tend to avoid taking any risk of flouting a non-existent law. What I think we can do is to show them the benefits of BITCOIN and why it is in their best interest to accept and they are responsible for whatever follows.'
p459
aS"yeah true what you say. You do not need to be engaged in encouraging and forcing them to use bitcoin. I'm sure one day they will be keen to accept bitcoin. This is just about the time bitcoin is growing each time. we just have to wait many local businesses will accept bitcoin later. I am sure of it"
p460
aS"Well in my own opinion, if a business man is going to try out with bitcoins it doesn't mean that you are going to fight against the local government.Just tell them that don't worry for this is not an illegal act or activities instead this is a real currency that they are going to benefit in the future.By simply explaining them basic background in bitcoin would suffice."
p461
aS"We can encourage local businesses to accept btc by information local businesses about what bitcoin is and how it will profit them aswell as the people if we all use it.They have to see the advantages before actually accepting it cause it's all about the money."
p462
aS' just tell to the local businesses shops the qualities aboutthe bitcoin . and tell them about its unlimited saving ofmoney without taxation . they will surely starts to acceptbitcoin .'
p463
aS"Indeed don't put any of the pressure on them and let them decide for themselves if you do this then it's more likely for them to actually accept bitcoin and look more into it than when you pressure them to really check it out etc."
p464
aS"the advantages are their priority and actually they're only seeking for profit so if bitcoin was not good enough to make an additional profit for them most likeley they will not accepting it,the only way to encourage those local businesses to accept bitcoin is by making it popular around them so they will get into it automatically"
p465
aS'agree I think you do not need to push it to join and adopt a system of bitcoin. let them see the advantages and benefits of bitcoin. if they see it directly batapa great bitcoin and ease of shopping, I am very sure that you need not force him they would gladly adopt bitcoin'
p466
aS"We can't really encourage local businesses maybe by spending more bitcoin etc so the prices circulate and it stays active.But we need more bitcoin commercial and information spread out so that businesses could get a hold of this information much easier."
p467
aS'And this is the right way to encourage adoption, when I began on bitcoin no one needed to convince me of the great advantages of bitcoin I was able to see it by myself and after that I became hooked with bitcoin.'
p468
aS'We can simply say that its better for them because they can control their own money and they can in that same time make profit too so I think that is just very nice.'
p469
aS'For now we can not encourage them because they are just few users who are using bitcoin if they know many people are using bitcoin in their country they can also accept bitcoin as payment like brazil that has 150 stores or more are accepting bitcoin locally in any local business.'
p470
aS'I also think that we should still not do this due to the fact that the bitcoin is still not far enough, I honestly hope that I can accept it as a business soon or later, if we want to encourage it we simply should make it more popular.'
p471
aS'I think even though the government banned the use bitcoin it would not deter a person to use bitcoin, yeah but maybe it would create a barrier to the store or business to accept bitcoin. because of course they are under government control'
p472
aS"simply because it could make them more profitable, but that does not mean we have to push and force them to join the bitcoin, because it would be very depressing. just tell them about the benefits if they accept bitcoin, I'm sure they will be joined by adopting bitcoin happily"
p473
aS'You can encourage local businesses to accept bitcoin by providing information to those local businesses.For example you could hand out info flyers with information about bitcoin pros and cons for businesses and a link for more information. They have to get to know more about it before they will accept it.'
p474
aS'It will be difficult to really encourage local businesses to use bitcoin cause eventually we are just customers and not business advisors.Somehow you have to get them to look up bitcoin for themselves something has to spark their interest about the options.'
p475
aS"We can encourage local businesses to accept Bitcoin by informing them what bitcoin is and how it can be productive for their business.As a business owner money talks so make the money talk and they'll join within a second if they see alot of ask for bitcoin payment method.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 "
p476
aS"Yes I agree with this but as a customer of said shop it's very difficult to educate the owner of the shop about bitcoin.They will be looking crazy if I walk in there trying to explain bitcoin, they'd probably think I would try to sell them something."
p477
aS'That could be a way to encourage adoption but the truth is unless there are enough users with bitcoin knocking at their doors then is very unlikely that doing something like that could encourage adoption.'
p478
aS'Explain bitcoin and the way it works, and how can bitcoin can expand their customers . Telling some personal experiences with bitcoin will be great also, Well if you got some proofs it will be a great help.'
p479
aS'Indeed if you have some examples on what kind of things it can really help you, you can really let them see how it works.I think that if they know its a currency but on the same time profitable in most cases, they will step in or get interested. '
p480
aS'This is the most hard thing in bitcoin community.How can we tell the other for using bitcoin especially for the merchant owner.When we wan to explain the advantage of bitcoin to them,they think wan we wan to sell something and in the end,they ignored us.'
p481
aS"Before you're could wanna for let them know about bitcoin or trying for tell them, please analyze your environment before and seeing how many the potential your environment about bitcoin payment, so you just not tell them a bullshit, supporting with the accurate data and may there will think for a twice accepting bitcoin."
p482
aS'Yes exactly they wont easily trust someone especially consumers to just use bitcoin, it will be hard to encourage them because they were careful in every actions they make. if you know personally a friend who is a business owner, its good to start convincing him because you are not stranger he might listen.'
p483
aS"You can encourage local businesses only by showing them what are the benefits of bitcoin and how simple it is to use it.For this we would probably need a stable price first because why would they want to adopt in it's current state."
p484
aS'Its not that easy. I have tried it myself with the most professional methods possible. The people just laughed at me and said "Sir, do you have anything to buy at all?" "We are not interested in this ponzi scheme so go away with you fake information"  They even started joking that I need to see a doctor to check my brain.  It will take several more years to get adopted properly.'
p485
aS"In my view it's better to accept bitcoin in our business rather than explaining someone who is new to the bitcoin as well other digital currency usage. Even now if people hesitate soon they will realise the true potential of bitcoin and start using it, because bitcoin and digital currency network is getting more popularity these days."
p486
aS'Well, that was very rude, but at the end of the day it\xc2\x92s their loss, not yours keep yourself on the forum and keep learning and obtaining bitcoin and at the end of the day you will be laughing all the way to the bank, oh wait, with bitcoin we are our own banks and we don\xc2\x92t need them. LOL. '
p487
aS'We can simply encourage them by saying its a nice investment and that you can make some nice amounts of money with it too if you are doing it on the right way.I also think that is the fact because its a investment and by holding already profit is mostly there.'
p488
aS'Good suggestion'
p489
aS'Most likely you can already make them interested with the part the bitcoin is already profitable by accepting it and than holding it.Most likely they will like it, everyone wants to make some money.'
p490
aS"The way to encourage the local business, it is right, but we know about it that local businessman are not using the enough online system and also in my country majority of those kind of business man who don't know about internet and they prefer to work in written.But i accept it if local businessman use the bitcoin in their business than definitely it is useful for them, but it is time taking work and people need time to know about bitcoin."
p491
aS"It's their loss?? Are you crazy?? They have succesfully maintain and getting profits out of their business and you think that is their loss if they accept bitcoin??What do you think of business owners if they will accept bitcoin, they will saved it? Wrong! They will rotate and circulate it to use to buy again some products to be sold."
p492
aS'I suggest you read the messages before posting any new post. If you read my earlier message I explained how the owners laughed at me when I tried to teach them and make them aware about bitcoin.Instead they started joking at my words and thought that I was trying to promote some scam and kicked me out - wxa7115 pointed out that this was rude of them and that the "owners" are at a loss SINCE they were not ready to accept bitcoinI guess you did not read the messages properly and that is why you got the message all wrong'
p493
aS"Indeed we can only do this, because it was something very powerful or easy to do. different than we do by way of introduction to the visual or media or advertising, it's almost the same with the introduction of the orally but it needs a lot more funds than have to do with oral."
p494
aS'This might be the best way although I foresee problems if a business owner would check out bitcoin and see how unstable and volatile the price actually is.This could cause them to lose money and losing money is a big nono for businesses obviously.'
p495
aS"Its Because it's really hard for them to see if only individual will push this coin to be added by companies or some other institution of people, and the best thing for it is really let them find ways to like the bitcoins itself and discover how big the market and the possibilities for this coin to get more potential to surge in the future, and im sure if they will see that surely many of them will surely jump off and grab the oppurtunity of bitcoins they can get and achieve, bitcoins has it's own ways to get exposure and the matter their is let's wait for them to analyze it properly."
p496
aS"Indeed but as a business aren't you looking for a stable currency instead of a volatile one where anything could happen?What if you make a big sale like 2k at once in a mediocre shop and then bitcoin drops by 50% and you lose half that would kill you."
p497
aS"That's my point in the past, no need to force them since they know what will be good for their local businesses.Also business owners are not meant to store and save bitcoin for long as their sole purpose is to circulate all their money for their investment to make it run."
p498
aS'Good thread btw...'
p499
aS'That is only a problem if they keep their bitcoin, with third party services it may be possible to accept bitcoin in the store but to receive fiat directly instead of bitcoin.'
p500
aS'explain to them the benefits of the coin in a honest simple way it will do the job by itself.'
p501
aS"If you wanted to have a business that is no volatile\xc2\xa0 , then i think you should not enter into a trading business we all know that even fiat's price is also volatile it keeps on fluctuating, only those who do not do trading can't feel the effects but this is the reality of currency world"
p502
aS"Yep that's obvious that we have to let to know them the advantages and disadvantages I just wish we had some kind of bitcoin commercials that could explain but that would probably be banned since it would be threatening to fiat. "
p503
aS"We can encourage local businesses by informing them about bitcoin what is bitcoin and the benefits of bitcoin.I think now is still too early though with this swinging price it's not really attractive to adopt bitcoin until more stable at least."
p504
aS'good to get your approval regarding the thread what do you think of the benefits when it comes to a retailer ,how is he going to change to fiat \xc2\xa0only thing need here is the ability to change the collected coins within hours to the necessary currency the retailer wanted,if that market gap is closed then local business will very well accept bitcoin'
p505
aS"During my whole bitcoin life i am really finding some time to do some research one what certain business that uses bitcoin as a medium of payment and what certain place can i avail those services and here are the things that made me realize1. Most of those entrepreneurs started to create a bitcoin related business because they've already experienced it2. Why did they put up some business? because they are innovative and was not satisfied by their bitcoin experience liked faucets or trading i guessThis reasons just come from a one point that they experienced using it first before they build up their business"
p506
aS'Any businesses is risky and volatile, there is no business that can guarantee success; you admitted that even fiat is volatile which means that the rest of the economy is volatile as well.'
p507
aS'You are right'
p508
aS"Indeed you basicly have to see it as that they are uneducated about bitcoin so using a system which you are uneducated about doesn't seem to make sense.But if you educate them about it then they will know what it is and the pros and cons."
p509
aS'Educating them about bitcoin would be\xc2\xa0 the best thing to do but the main\xc2\xa0 question here is\xc2\xa0 the adoption\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0of a certain\xc2\xa0 country, lets say they are interested to adopt bitcoin in their\xc2\xa0 businesses\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 but the adoption is less on a certain place then\xc2\xa0 it would be still useless at all. You sucesfuly\xc2\xa0 encourage them but\xc2\xa0 the adoption would be the hindrance.'
p510
aS"Perhaps showing them the price of how btc goes down and raises back to get them confident into a cryptocurrency as i suppose right now because its digital, people can't see the physical product they might just use back the original currency"
p511
aS"that's the dumbest thing you will ever do if you're showing this fluctuative characteristic to those local business even though it will be honest ,but are you for real? local business would seek any possible of the most stable currency to control their profit and it's just dumb i think."
p512
aS'Yup adoption only make change in bitcoin revolution, Most of the people does not know bitcoin and its features So much we can. We should spread about the bitcoin out of forum and we should atract the people bitcoin feature and make them to utilise the bitcoin in their business purchases.'
p513
aS"Just hire one person more in you're business,which would ask people about if they would like to pay here with bitcoins,online or at the shop.It is not hard to get research right? At least that what I think."
p514
aS'This is why if we are to encourage adoption we should begin by those business that have electronic products like eBooks and software or that can export physical products that way they will not be limited by local adoption in their respective countries.'
p515
aS'We should just tell them the things you can do with it and why they should use it because its such an good currency.They can easily make profit with it by selling items for it and also by holding on the same time.'
p516
aS'I always round up when paying with btc. I think an extra few cents/dollars on top of the bill is always a good experience for the business,\xc2\xa0 and doubly so if the price rises afterwards.'
p517
aS'We can encourage local businesses to accept Bitcoin by actually using our bitcoin cause most of the coin is idle.Next to that we can inform those said businesses about bitcoin and teach them a thing or two so they get interested.'
p518
aS'How to encourage local businesses to accept btc hmm.. good question and difficult to answer. I don\'t think "we" here stands for the bitcoin users but more for bitcoin itself, they have to somehow show their attractive side to business owners.'
p519
aS'In fact this is incorrect; there\xc2\x92s is a great amount of trade taking every day in the world of bitcoin, although you will see a lot of people in this forum saying they are holding their coins most people are in fact doing something with their bitcoins.'
p520
aS"It's actually very simple. They need to see that people are spending their coins on a massive scale in order to get the incentive they need to list a Bitcoin payment option.But as we speak, most people are not really interested in spending their coins as they focus more on the investment aspect of Bitcoin.Will we see any kind of business accept Bitcoin as a payment form, then keep/start spending. More can you not do."
p521
aS'It is not an easy process introducing a new way of payment because there are several questions with it. Suppose they accept bitcoin will even one person pay using bitcoin. And also there is an issue about taxes the government will try to chase you about you earning money without having a record of your earning because they are all bitcoin. That can be rough for businesses. I think you should introduce bitcoin to governments first and make it a legal thing. '
p522
aS"Indeed, it needs deep analytical studies so companies won't get compromise since bitcoins regularly flactuates up nor down, and this could be the hardest decision to them since bitcoin is unknown for all of people globally, and chances to lose money for its unstability well exist and im really sure this study for its acceptance would take for more longer years since bitcoin is unpredictable processor."
p523
aS'We can encourage local businesses to accept bitcoin by just using bitcoin and having a stable price cause not having a stable price is a red flag for any business that wants to adopt a new payment method in my opinion.'
p524
aS"My idea to encourage local businesses to accept bitcoin is to have them get information via flyers for example.We don't have any advertisement for bitcoin which is a bummer cause somehow it has to spread information."
p525
aS'I think it will not work. As long as bitcoin is not that present and active in those local businesses we can never sees acceptance of it in most of the stores.No need for us to encourage them because they can see actively if bitcoin is actively operating in their area.'
p526
aS"All this also depends on the user bitcoin in promoting or introducing bitcoin to everyone. If we're not doing any contributions to the growth of the bitcoin then you said would happen, because something is not recognized then it will not be used although it can give you a better advantage than ever before"
p527
aS'Hi mate.I just read the very first page of this thread.I just want to say that it will be hard for you to attract many people to use BTC especially from the local area, like you need to introduce what is BTC all about how it grow ups and downs.'
p528
aS'Some shops already have qr codes to pay. Show them how easy and cheap it is to setup a qr transaction and how to include intirgrate of bitcoin within the store and tell them more about bitcoin itself.'
p529
aS"How hard we promote if local business didn't see some good reason to accept it then it will be hard.The best way if by chance a person that know bitcoin will start making a ocal business and will start to accept bitcoin too. If other competitors will see it then they can consider to conduct a study about what is the benefits of using biticoin."
p530
aS'We can encourage them by doing some nice offerings and I think if they know they can control it by themselves and also earn and make profit by holding they will invest it for sure.The fact that it can be globally used is also attractable for them.'
p531
aS"Hmm that might be a very difficult thing to do as a bitcoin user no? To just encourage a business to accept bitcoin you need a lot of convincing power and proof that it's profitable for them.I wouldn't know how we could reach this together but I do hope it happens."
p532
aS'Not just convincing power but aswell data analysis about bitcoins since it will tell that bitcoins are really worth to accept with, but its very hard really to see the potential of bitcoins for business acceptance since the price of it is so unstable and might they gonna earn some loss if some certain breakdown will gonna happen unto the bitcoin, and we cannot trust its stability since its also known as money killer.'
p533
aS'It would really hard to convince a business\xc2\xa0 owner to recieve\xc2\xa0 bitcoin\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0hence they would really hesitate\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0because\xc2\xa0 bitcoin isnt\xc2\xa0 adopted\xc2\xa0 all over the world\xc2\xa0 and some\xc2\xa0 places didnt even\xc2\xa0 heard\xc2\xa0 about it . There would\xc2\xa0 really a time for this\xc2\xa0 which\xc2\xa0 some\xc2\xa0 of merchants\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0would\xc2\xa0 accept bitcoin as a payment.'
p534
aS'Showing some advabtages of bitcoin is one of the most effective ways to persuade local business to accept bitcoin. Let them see what bitcoin can bring to our life, how does the Blockchain work, how fast it is when sending bitcoin. However, if the government does not allow people to use bitcoin, there is no way for business to accept bitcoin'
p535
aS"Encourage local businesses by just using bitcoin and showing them it's actually a currency and it is being used.Cause if they don't see that it's globally used then it's no reason for them to add it to their payment methods ofcourse"
p536
aS"Actualy its more than that to make them say yes to bitcoin. For example how does car brands accept loan payment for up to 5 years or 60 monthly payments and don't have any interest. It is because they are encourage by banks to do it and they are being paid to use it\xc2\xa0 . It is a win win scenario where a bank can say that there card gas many uses and has 0% interest on using it as a payment method. "
p537
aS'Bitcoin is legal and you can declare it in your taxes, although you will need to see the regulations in your country since as far as I know is not recognized as a currency but as a commodity, second bitcoin leaves a trace of every transaction on the blockchain so it\xc2\x92s not like there are to records of your transactions for the government to see.'
p538
aS"I agree that it really takes more than a story to make businesses accept bitcoin.\xc2\xa0 Regarding to percent interest, we all know that it was already marked-up on the item.\xc2\xa0 You can do the same even if you use bitcoin to pay for your car loans.\xc2\xa0 In the world of business, it is impossible to believe that people don't have commision in their services.\xc2\xa0 There is always a catch."
p539
aS'perhaps by introducing bitcoin to the community, and local sellers. besides that we also have to explain the advantages and benefits bitcoin transactions are easy and fast. simply multiply excellence in bitcoin might also be introduced. so maybe they would be interested to receive and use bitcoin'
p540
aS'To encourage small businesses to accept BTC, first there should be enough demand for paying with BTC. During the crisis in Greece, we could push the Bitcoin to the country, place the BTC ATM\'s, "Square"(the company) style BTC swipers and encourage people to buy Bitcoin from a greek BTC exchange website.'
p541
aS'Times of crisis are also times of opportunity while I have no knowledge about the Greece situation I do know that in Argentina during the crisis bitcoin adoption grew because of the tight control of the government.'
p542
aS'Encouraging small businesses and local is very difficult in many countries because of price and some other factors specially in developing countries because peoples have many problems related to networks and electricity its need time and some special effort which is doing by some hope this could be good in near future for bitcoins and all of us '
p543
aS'The point about demand is absolutely correct and i have no knowledge that crisis thing in Greece or anywhere, but i surely know that a local business before starting to accept bitcoin as a payment system should make sure if bitcoin is in demand in that location so that if he adopts it he do not face failure.'
p544
aS'I think that Bitcoin is already making good moves with making a deal with Steam now they have to get amazon as well. If they manage to get amazon then they will get more popular. Bitcoin needs to get popular among the people so that the local businesses will get interested. '
p545
aS'Accepting bitcoins does not cost anything so I have my doubts that any business is going to lose anything by accepting bitcoin, if in the other hand the business only accepted bitcoin then that would be different, but no one here is recommending that.'
p546
aS'You really need to encourage them indeed but I think with sone good words its already possible and they just have to look it up and they will see why its than a pretty good currency to use and also to hold..'
p547
aS'Yes we can do this but its not very easy to do this, its all about what business see in it and its also what they are doing.Some businesses are selling other things that makes it not even interesting.'
p548
aS"There is no many ways how to encourage business to accept bitcoins. They are afraid of unstable price of bitcoin, it's hard to declare and pay taxes for it and finally, they still need to exchange received btc their local currency. And most imprtant thing - there is still not enough people who will pay in bitcoin. And it's like closed circle - many people don't use bitcoin, because it's hard to find places where bitcoin accepted."
p549
aS'Well this is really hard just like you are going to proposed a project to the big investors but in this case you are going to make bitcoin as your mainstream. And the question is how you are going to make the businessmen in your place to say yes for bitcoin is not yet popular in your place. Just make some good presentation for it.'
p550
aS'You need for researching about some fact in the environment of the store before giving a suggest to the store for accepting bitcoin and I just say this for preventing if there is not enough bitcoiners in the environment and why the store are really need for accepting bitcoin?'
p551
aS'Shops are in business for a single reason profit, if they don\xc2\x92t see a clear way to profit from bitcoin they are not going to adopt it, it\xc2\x92s that simple and if they cannot profit from it then the decision to not adopt it is savvy business decision. '
p552
aS'Exactly, if a place has not bitcoin users at all or if has then they are really few in number so how come you can encourage a local business to accept bitcoin as a way of payment? They would only do it if they see some great potentials in it but if they see nothing about it around the they would probably say no to it.'
p553
aS'Right now only way of encouraging bitcoin in business is in the hands of big offline shops. Let that be a grocery, stationary, food court or anything. Always small shops follow business methods of big shops. So this will encourage the small scale business to use bitcoin in their services as an additional option.'
p554
aS'Businesses\xc2\x92 follows the money, bitcoin has not reached a point in which adoption is a necessity for a business to survive, the same happen to credit cards when they were first introduced it took some time for them to be accepted and now a business that does not accept credit cards is destined to failure.'
p555
aS'For now it definitely has not reached the tipping point, but its adoption spreading greatly anyway. We will definitely see traditional businesses turning to bitcoin sooner or later and for obvious reasons those selling digital goods will lead the way.'
p556
aS"In my country lots of people don't use bitcoins because they don't know how to operate. Bitcoins is new system and it will take some time to understand it to most of people."
p557
aS'While bitcoin can be very easy to use, it can be really difficult to explain it to some persons; they don\xc2\x92t understand the concept of a digital p2p currency.'
p558
aS'This is true fro my city as well, while other states in my country have accepted it to some extent. It is like a cultish following here. However the number of users is growing slowly. Local shops are not accepting it and hence people are not learning about it. A very aggressive advertising/crowd-sale may change the scenario here.'
p559
aS"Abby are already explaining about most of the people in their country are not know how to operating the bitcoin but somehow you're repeating that again. if they are don't know how to operate and how they can understand the concept of the cryptocurrency? "
p560
aS"Well, we obviously have to tell them about the pros of it. For instance, say that using $ or some other currency, if they don't violate the law, they have to pay huge taxes, which can destroy their business making it unprofitable. BTC is tax-free and you can manage to exchange it for some $ if you like."
p561
aS'The tax man can easily get the information about the gross sales of a merchant if all the sales are done via bitcoins, since its a public information to check all the transactions. '
p562
aS'Small local businesses are always interested to accept something that will make their business cheaper, simpler and more afortable and atractive to people. So a good will and patience is needed to explain them how can they improve their business by accepting Bitcoin.'
p563
aS"Yeah that's something indeed desired by all entrepreneurs not only small entrepreneurs. However before doing something I think we should be able to think of something that it is possible to happen in the future, for something to do in the absence of a good plan will give results that are less well. Businesses should have to do something than to have planned things concerned with the emotional. It is indeed good to use bitcoin as payment or transaction, but if you can not use the bitcoin perfectly then I think it has not been able to give a good effect"
p564
aS"But as long as in that area of concern, bitcoin is not that famous, owners will think of accepting bitcoin is just useless since no one will try that.But if the owner is bitcoin enthusiast then it's not a problem since part of it may be considered as bitcoin promotion in that specific area."
p565
aS'While businesses are always looking for ways to optimize themselves they will do so only if it brings profits, so a wide user base must be in place in order to allow this to happen, in my opinion this could only be possible in some modern cities.'
p566
aS'Yes more users in a certain area, more chances of that specific stores to accept and hug bitcoin as mode of payment since the services will be now regularly used.But like what I said above, if the owner somehow knows bitcoin and in any cases they are also a bitcoin enthusiast, they can start accepting bitcoin in their store even there is no much people using it in their place.'
p567
aS'I think it is better to let many online bitcoin accepters appear before the local shops to accept the bitcoin.'
p568
aS"All company's are interested in making profit and with the bitcoin this possible, you can let anyone pay with the bitcoin that are coming from all over the world and you can control it yourself too."
p569
aS'I agree that all company are interested in profit.\xc2\xa0 May it be bitcoin or fiat, there is nothing else in their mind but profit.\xc2\xa0 And these businessmen are smart too; others are clever enough to make a profit even if everyone else thinks that it is a loss.\xc2\xa0 But you need more than a concept to persuade this kind of people.\xc2\xa0 You need to show all the technicalities and proof, the pros and cons.\xc2\xa0 The add-on financial investment and the impact on their business if they adopt bitcoin.'
p570
aS'But comparatively, a shop owner will be gaining more profit by accepting bitcoin payments and more business too. With the adoption of bitcoin payment, a business may attract more number of people than without having bitcoin payment options. But obviously, the business owners must promote their bitcoin acceptances so that they will get more businesses and comparatively more profits by saving in transaction fees.'
p571
aS'In my opinion as long we accept scam like ponzi, hyip and all the other shit which destroy the image of this wonderfull invetion there will be no good future for bitcoin. It still will be a currency of the criminals. There have to be a rethinking.'
p572
aS'I have not think of that, but you are correct if a business owner is a bitcoiners then he can accept bitcoin even if there is not a large user base since accepting bitcoin does not require any kind of special technology and it\xc2\x92s free for anyone.'
p573
aS'All these things have given a bad name to bitcoin and this cannot be undone. What needs to be done is an aggressive advertising/crowdsale in countries where bitcoin is not accepted yet.Most business are not ready to accept it because of flux in price and the bad name that has been brought, for them bitcoin=scam'
p574
aS"I don't think that we can help them, as there are not enough people that wants to pay in bitcoins yet so there is no point for them to let us pay in bitcoins yet"
p575
aS"yes course FIAT is also volatile. In the first place i've only said that you should never be on the trading business, of course most the business are risky but the % of that risk is not the same as trading you still go to a much lower % of risk type of business."
p576
aS'Why not buddy If you are running any business like shops, trade business, hotel and etc.. you can able to initiate the bitcoin as the payment in buying or selling things in your business. This thing can help the people with the local business.'
p577
aS'It can be undone; if it was not then there will not be any new users, personally I disagree with spending money in advertising since adoption must be organic so we can avoid bubbles and stuff like that.'
p578
aS"Holy cow but I not have seen the relationship of the ponzi and hyip, it's bad for the investing person and the image of bitcoin but for to encourage local store for accepting bitcoin and i not seem any trouble with it, and are you refer the image will affecting the potentially of local store accepting bitcoin? I can say no this is just the relationship about the profitable."
p579
aS"I don't think that is related bro, because even fiat money is being used by criminals not only Bitcoins. The progress of bitcoin is slow in terms of how businesses accept it is because they still don't know it yet, even if they accept bitcoin will their ever be a customer who will pay bitcoin also their is a problem with their government's taxes on how will they tax something that only virtually exist."
p580
aS'It might be low for today, but if we are just going to explain to them clearly if they are going to use and start accepting bitcoins then for sure it might encourage them.Just tell him some success stories on how did bitcoin changed their lives but also tell them some bad incidents about it.So that they will be cautious about it.'
p581
aS'No local business would or should announce bitcoin payments without any survey for checking if there are enough bitcoin users around so that they can get some customers who are willing to pay in bitcoins, otherwise their adoption would be purposeless if there is no one willing to pay with bitcoins around there.'
p582
aS'Well thats right but considering to have lesser value if someone will use btc as a payment make them to look for it to consider as we all knew that businessman always looking for some edge having some extra earnings will move them to accept btc for sure.'
p583
aS"Yeah that's right bitcoin still need to be introduced to business owners they must know how it works and also the estimated number of people who uses it otherwise it will be nonsense for them to accept bitcoins without proper knowledge. "
p584
aS"If bitcoin were not so volatile when it comes to price, I truly believe that many small business would use the currency. With the price varying so much more than the price of a dollar, it's hard to say whether the consumer or the business would get an advantage. "
p585
aS'I think it really depends on the kind of business you have, if the business we are talking has something to do with technology then I think it is a lot more likely that some of the clients are already using bitcoins in their lives.'
p586
aS'Right, I guess if we are wanna for comparing the criminalities of the fiat and bitcoin I think the fiat will give more than bitcoin, and I sure if a lot of people does not know about the disadvantages of using bitcoin in this day, but totally will need more researching for bitcoin will be the complete combination for business.'
p587
aS'We should aware them the facilities of using bitcoin.Like, we can tell them about low transactions fees of bitcoin.More, we can tell them about the security of bitcoin.We can encourage them to invest on bitcoin cause it can give them profit.'
p588
aS'But all of that is useless if there\xc2\x92s not a user base that can generate them profits in the short and long term since that is what a business is about and they will only take measures that make sense economically for them.'
p589
aS'I agree but you should note that most of the clicks and visits that appear in your analytics are actually bots and fake traffic, used to boost the traffic but are totally inorganic. Thats is why people tend to steer clear of most advertising networks using bitcoin and prefer the older more organic ones.However internet advertising of bitcoin can help local business if and only if they are themselves willing to accept it - which I am afraid from my own personal experience, not.'
p590
aS'Encouraging\xc2\xa0 local business\xc2\xa0 to use bitcoin\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0would\xc2\xa0 be really hard\xc2\xa0 though\xc2\xa0 because\xc2\xa0 most\xc2\xa0 of them\xc2\xa0 even\xc2\xa0 didnt heard\xc2\xa0 about bitcoin and\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0they\xc2\xa0 would surely refuse\xc2\xa0 to use it. COnvincing them would really\xc2\xa0 a problem\xc2\xa0 though\xc2\xa0 except to those merchants who already accepts\xc2\xa0 bitcoin as\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0a payment. But still i\xc2\xa0 believe that this adoption would really\xc2\xa0 spread all over the\xc2\xa0 world.'
p591
aS'Convincing a local business to accept bitcoin would not be a problem at all if they really find it working, and for that they should probably see some people using bitcoins around because without regular customers they would not adopt it as it would be of no use in that way.'
p592
aS'I guess the best solution for it was trying to create your own business that uses bitcoin as a medium of payment do it small because your goal would be introducing it to them if they try to see what you currently are doing they would also try to adopt it\xc2\xa0 '
p593
aS'I think local business will be able to accept bitcoin if they see its potential. So, me must try to use bitcoin often to make its movement continuous and male its price rise so they will become attracted. Plus, we must establish a business that bitcoin operates. In this case, they will become aware of what bitcoin can do. An sooner or later they will tend to accept it.'
p594
aS'You cannot say that local businesses will not prefer adopt bitcoins. There are reasons why they are now willing and not willing to do so for now maybe one simple reason must be they know little or nothing about bitcoin. But, as time goes on, it will get to a time that most of those businesses will be begging you to pay them through bitcoin. I am sure those magic times will come in real soon.'
p595
aS'As\xc2\xa0 we all expecting that the trend will go up and the public market will buy the service we know bitcoin will keep on rising and investors will keep coming to ride.'
p596
aS'Our Local Wallet for Bitcoins actually encourage us users to pay our bills using their wallets payment system, in which several of our utility bills accept bitcoin. They even add rebates if we choose to pay our bills with them. Having that said many companies now accept bitcoin as payment or if I am right the local wallet we have use bitcoin and convert it to fiat in which they pay for the company. Time will tell if Local Businesses accept Bitcoin as a mode of payment for them. '
p597
aS'Wow, it was great and this will be the beginning of the growth of the bitcoin became better. Indeed it is now there are a few things we can do using bitcoin, but for now I see online stores that still have not received the bitcoin for one of the means of payment. Bitcoin would be much more beneficial if we could cooperate in the growth of the bitcoin get better from now on. the company will accept bitcoin if bitcoin user already has 40% of the total population in the world'
p598
aS'No one can start a business just with the hope that he will get customers, but the business are started because of the demand for that thing in that locality, so if the users around there are not willing to use bitcoins or are not aware of it at all then you would face problems to create and improve your business there.'
p599
aS'If you have a product whether physical or online then most likely you are going to need to invest in marketing since there are only a few selected brands that can survive without paying any advertising.'
p600
aS"The time when almost everyone would be using bitcoins will come for sure... but i don't think anyone would beg someone to pay them with bitcoins as in that time there will be a lot of customers for them willing to pay them with bitcoins so they wont need to do anything like that i guess..."
p601
aS'Do not you ever see some banks are proving special discounts for using on particular shop ?Why not we may consider them like begging to use their cards? similarly we may get times shops will provide huge offers for bitcoin payments to enforce people to pay in bitcoins.'
p602
aS"The only reasons I can think of is that merchants either haven't heard of Bitcoin yet, or they are afraid to incorporate Bitcoin payments into their site due to the volatility. In case of the latter option, they are wrong. Volatility isn't something merchants have to deal with as 95% of the merchants are using a payment processor to have all their Bitcoin sales converted to fiat directly. They don't risk anything.I think that's something a lot merchants don't seem to realize. They probably think that when they sell something for $100 in BTC, and the price goes down, that they lose money.If that's really the case, then more needs to be done to inform merchants about the benefits of having a payment processor such as BitPay to work for them."
p603
aS'It is still hard if people especially the business owner did not believe in bitcoin they still have a lot of doubt.And it was the biggest problem that bitcoin have to solved.As tine goes by indeed people will say welcome to bitcoin , but looks like it is required time longer than expected.'

aS'Who sell the frozen dog meat for Bitcoin in China?'
p605
aS'This is really a very hard thing that we are going to encourage them to use bitcoin. But I think by just simply showing them the value of bitcoins today for sure they are going to get excited to it and will going to be a good start for them that will make a new unique trend in your community if they are going to accept bitcoin.'
p606
aS'WOWTry to show it to some business owner in the first person.You will fail.Business owners need customers, no "the value of bitcoins today".No usual people is paid in bitcoin to spend them.'
p607
aS'Its indeed very hard to let people believe in the bitcoin and if they are already not doing it and not like it they will without any doubts not step into it.The bitcoin is a great currency but it needs more positive publicity.'
p608
aS'Open yourself a shop, and show, how it work, positively.'
p609
aS'It is actually not so easy to make a shop and accept bitcoins for it as a payment... because maybe people around you are still not aware of it and making them know about it would take some time... first someone should try to do some survey in the town to know the interests of different kind of people and if you really find it in their interests then go for it...'
p610
aS'If You offer a good product, you will have customers for sure.For example, in my signature Bitcoin Cam Site are Adult Shows for free. (NSFW)It work as BTC business model.'
p611
aS'Personally I think one of the bigger problems with bitcoin is that although is very easy to use, it can be difficult to grasp for the average person; the concept of an electronic currency with no government to back it up seems odd for the average person.'
p612
aS"I agree this is one of the concern of the merchants.\xc2\xa0 Basically legit merchants wants to use things that are approved by the government so they don't have to worry about tax evasion and other issue that arise with non-compliance issue.\xc2\xa0 They also wanted their business to be covered with insurance so when something unexpecte happen they have someone to back them.\xc2\xa0 With bitcoin, there is no such thing as insurance company that will back you in case you got problem with bitcoin."
p613
aS'Just check how it work in my signature website. (NSFW)No such problems.'
p614
aS"How come an NSFW sites offer a insurance company? Or you just miss quoted this message? And maybe you need to make your own thread and don't stumble your site in the comment section people don't ask about that and its Out of topic since the question is not similar to your posted messages, and if you really running one of those how can you make sure that you would not run their money?"
p615
aS'It\'s quite hard to convince people who doesn\'t have at least a reasonable knowledge about this "new" payment system... I sell musical instruments and electronics cheaper (10%) if the client negotiate with Bitcoin. I also sell shirts and lotta music related stuffs. I put in local newspaper that I accept Bitcoin, but I just sold ~10 itens directly.'
p616
aS'You should explain them the benefits of accepting Bitcoins as payment. Your transactions cannot be traced by government and so your income will be tax free.Payments once you got through bitcoin\xc2\xa0 cannot be replaced to customers.You should explain these benefits. Rather you could show them video documentaries about bitcoin to make them understand easily.'
p617
aS'Easy. Just test it. No problems with bitcoin accepting.'
p618
aS'LOLThe product delivery is traced by post or locally by agents.'
p619
aS'The most basic thing is the mentality of people living around you, if they have any interest in something like bitcoin then you will probably get some customers but if the environment around you is quite of old mentality who does not like any change then it would become hard for you to run a business accepting bitcoins as a payment for it.'
p620
aS'Payments are made not with mentality. Who have no BTC, they goes to use money from income.'
p621
aS'First of all, all the transactions can be traced since anyone can see the blockchain and see every single transaction ever made, second any income can be taxed even if the tax for something is zero it should be declared to avoid problems, for most business owners if you said something like that they will run away from bitcoin and never come back.'
p622
aS'But if he provide all of those products which are all imported and all of them are unique and amazing for the community around him then people will like to buy that things and for that they will learn about bitcoin and will start to buy things from him with bitcoin. '

aS'For a local business, you will find 1 from 100.000 costumers that will pay in bitcoin.Online things can be more easy but local is almost impossible.'
p624
aS'First tr to promote the concept of bitcoin in your local area to everyone and make sure that now they will adopt bitcoin easily without any hurdle so when you will then start a local business and people will start using your service then other local businesses will also use bitcoin for themselves. '
p625
aS'It will take a lot of time and aggressive advertising and crowdsale to get that 1% to at least 30% of population who accept and use bitcoin. In countries where people have never heard of bitcoin, it is extremely difficult to make them understand and accept the integrity and security of the coin let alone try transacting on it.I dont think any company or team will be willing to invest in such an advertisement because they may not just ROI that amount and end up as laughing stock on the stage with people screaming "scam/ponzi" at them.'
p626
aS'I agree and the best thing to do with this seminars or conference is during an events or fares where business people gathers and looking for somethig new, either a technology or designs.\xc2\xa0 This way you can advertise about bitcoin and at the same time invite them to your seminar.\xc2\xa0 Just be creative when you do your flyers because it is where you can attract this business people in taking attention to your plan.'
p627
aS'Though it is not impossible but we can surely call it hard to promote bitcoin in our local areas because the people around us have never heard of something like this where your money is kept on internet and you just can use them by internet but not like using paper money, so it would probably be quite hard to get customers for this at first.'
p628
aS"Where I live for an example, very few people heared about Bitcoins. But they aren't interested on it anyway, they will say it's a hard method to earn money, or that it's a fraudulent method to earn, bla bla bla... So, I just go by myself and don't lose much time with others. Some people are living on old days yet, they don't want to see the real benefits the internet is promoting to us with BTCs."
p629
aS'I agree its the new way to gain profit and make your company very popular these days, I really think its a hole in the market this days.'
p630
aS'There is a need to conduct discussion or rather conduct a live seminar just to introduce bitcoin to local businesses.How it well works and how it will process in businesses. Because some other people doesnt know yet bitcoin.Also we need atleast more participants to attend the seminarthat introduces bitcoin. '
p631
aS'ahhha, all things considered would not be done in the bitcoin is something very ridiculous. Because it was very clear that bitcoin is going to be a revolution in the transaction in the future, so if there are people who can not accept bitcoin or considers paltry bitcoin then in the future we will laugh at them as you say'
p632
aS"they are usually laughing at you because they really don't have any knowledge about bitcoin and does not want to know about it . they find it ridiculous and thinking about how can you make a profit if you are just being paid with an unknown currency for them . but maybe if you get succeed with bitcoin you can encourage other businesses to accept bitcoin because as they will see it and learned from you ."
p633
aS'It is possible to accept btc as an payment if the simple shopkeeper understand about the bitcoin beauty .first of all we need to explain them about the ease to use Bitcoin and the benefit of having btc .this type of conversation will make local shops to accept bitcoin as an payment .'
p634
aS'Its not their fault actually, they have never changed their way of life until now so it would probably be hard for them to accept a change in their way of living which is accepting or using bitcoins, that is the reason why it is hard to convince a community or an environment about bitcoin and promote a business regarding bitcoin infront of them.'
p635
aS"It will take much long for bitcoin to make a certain impact on people's lives and then you may expect people to accept it more. However I think people are very cautious about their money and dont really trust the coin much due to previous attempts of ponzi scams, scam cloud-mining sites and other illegal stuff. It is difficult since the first impression has been bad and will take some time and effort to overcome."
p636
aS'I guess it hard to put BTC to the real economy in each country, there are many process you need to come up before you achieve that goal. If I am not mistaken you, first thing you must do is to introduce the BITCOIN to the public, what are the advantages of having it in their part, what is best thing of having that compare to the fiat currencies. How can they have it. You have to open their mind in the current status of it, how the value increases and decreases. As other say also make some remarkable about bitcoin and make it more attractive for them to be persuade if you pursue it.One more thing, maybe it depends on the country you belong to, there are countries that only few knew about bitcoin but there are also country who is open to use bitcoin in their business and many are using it.'
p637
aS"Where the owner of the local business will spend their bitcoin? He can't pay their bills with bitcoinSo they will have to pay taxes to an exchange so at the end of history, isn't a big deal accepting bitcoin if you can't hold or spend somewhere(like bills)."
p638
aS'Spending them wont be a problem if they can earn them, they can simply exchange them to fiat later on if they want, that wont cost him too much and besides, the price of bitcoin may grow higher so they might even earn some extra money out of it, but the question is whether will they be able to get bitcoin customers or not.'
p639
aS"That's something the right thing. But what all business owners who accept bitcoin will always wait the price first new high bitcoin playing cashflow in its business..?? . There comes a time employers have to find profit enough to rotate the shops they have and there is definitely a time customers will be given the advantage of loyalty to use or buy any thing that is in the store"
p640
aS'I think we should introduced bitcoin to them properly. Then we can aware them about the advantages of bitcoin like bitcoins security, low transactions fee,instant payment confirmation.And we can also tell them about bitcoin investment which is very good to earn quick profit.'
p641
aS"Before watching the news, there is a country to take the form of teaching to promote learning.This is a good way. But, I think the best way is the country's recognition, the country's recognition is the most conducive to the development of btc."
p642
aS"let me give an example. last night my friend visited me in my home, he asked what i am doing for now. i answered that i am trading with bitcoin. after give him some explanation, he still can't believe if bitcoin can help to make money although we use bitcoin for trading. he make bitcoin same as forex and i told him that bitcoin its different than forex. i give the simple analysis like if supply decrease, then demand will be increase and its make the price reach so high and he agree with this. the other session, he asked about how we know that the price will go increase? i answer that its depend on many things like the news about bitcoin itself, the market condition, economic global news, and else. the point is my friend not yet accepted that bitcoin can help people with the simple, fast, cheap and not depending for places and time.this is just happen with another of my friend which is open his business and said maybe later he will found out the good thing about bitcoin and i don't want to push him to know and learn bitcoin, let him search by his self. not much that we can make sure people to accept bitcoin but i am sure that in future many people will be realize the benefit of bitcoin and they want to use it like what we have done now."
p643
aS'I thought that the Bitcoin community could help to teach the local businesses to how it may assist them and develop them. Bitcoin should give them some benefit as consideration.'
p644
aS"I don't think I need to do anything.Bit coins will be accepted by people, this is the trend of development of the times."
p645
aS'But this is a good chance to promote bitcoins to the business near you and you can just simply offer yourself as a business bitcoin advisor to those local middle level businesses. Since we already know that this will be accepted by people in the future that will be an advantage if you will introduce to them bitcoin by simply explaining them what bitcoin is.'
p646
aS"It actually looks easy when we say it but it is really hard to promote bitcoin around you since you don't know if there are any people interested about it, because it may turn wrong for you if you introduced it to someone who is against bitcoin because we know that not everyone in the world like bitcoin like us."
p647
aS'Give them insentives. Present the market if bitcoin through peruasing them. Give the the platform, purpose, use, and advabtages of bitcoin in the market. It is very significant for you to do a deeper findings on the maket you are marketing.'
p648
aS'Doing any of these things wont make bitcoin accepted by a local business at all, because the basic thing that we need to know before starting a business is the interest in people around us, if they are interested about something we can start that business, but without knowing if there are anyone interested about the service we would probably not do that, so if a local business does not find anyone interested in bitcoin around him except you, they wont use bitcoin at all.'
p649
aS'It is not that easy since there are lots of misinformation in the air thanks to the media, so I\xc2\x92m pretty sure many people will think it twice before wanting to have anything with a person out of the blue telling them what to do with their business.'
p650
aS'Rush into their shop with screaming and shouting waving you guns around and tell them to use btc or you will murder their family xPNah just joking  Just show them the ease and close to nothing cost of setup and fees. Show them the speed and security. Instead of keeping a tab someone can Eben keep am escrow open with your shop like at a bar for example. '
p651
aS'LOL,small cost to nothing setup? \xc2\xa0Does the gadget cost nothing? the internet? \xc2\xa0and other device that is use to make the service of accepting bitcoin available. \xc2\xa0Aside from software you need hardware to implement the project. \xc2\xa0You also need to setup a special program to integrate bitcoin to your payment processor. \xc2\xa0There is no question in security but the speed, we all know it is a pain to wait for the confirmation. \xc2\xa0'
p652
aS'Not totally cost nothing but he said close to nothing cost of setup and fees. Still there are some fees and capital is in need. But it is more cheaper than the usual capital that a store owners needs to put out of his pocket. I guess those type of programs are not necessarry for a small shop that accepts bitcoin near you. Because the owner can just implement direct payment to his wallet address.'
p653
aS'To encourage some local business to use bitcoin as their payment method is hard, but once you explain to them how big is the advantage of having bitcoin in their wallet for sure they will make it up to you. All you need is just a big and beautiful encouraging words that will for sure persuade them to use this way of payment. And it is all better to make some proof so they will not think that the transaction will be scammed to be trafficked and lead to other\xc2\x92s wallet.'
p654
aS'Of course this is not an easy thing, but I guess if you are that popularity in your place that is going to be a big plus and you built trust in your community.And you just need to clearly explain to them what is the essentials and benefits that may get if they will accept bitcoins as payment to their products.Just tell them, there is no need for investment. For this is alternative way of paying and being paid.'
p655
aS'Even local businesses use support, the problem is still the lack of people actually paying with bitcoin.In some countries the community is very small (just check the activity of some local subforums) and, except for those gaining BTC through mining, the process of obtaining BTC to then buy something from a local business is way more cumbersome than simply paying with a credit card directly.'
p656
aS'They need to decide it by it self to accept it as mode of payment . As far as I know some country already do that even using other altcoin.Just tell them what is the good side of using bitcoin and how it works and they will decide if they can accept it or not.'
p657
aS"Yes it is like you are selling fish near the shore, where most of the people doesn't have interest at all. But if you will just have a clear talk to the people that has business and able to explain them that bitcoin can be a good medium to their business for accepting orders and payments online. Everything can be done with talks as long you explained it to them, it will stick to their mind."
p658
aS"You already have those kind of things. Most business have their own computer, has an internet connection, and everyone has a smartphone. You don't have to spend some more money because you have that in your shop by default. I don't know why would you be needing a software though. They just have to scan your QR code and send their payment. The guy on the counter will then check if it was successfully received. Maybe if you want to automate all of these then you'd need to setup a software but for the meantime, you can still do it manually. It's not that much work especially for small scale businesses."
p659
aS'i think not much of the media giving the information about bitcoin because until now, i can not find in any media that talk or discuss about bitcoin. the bitcoin is spread by person to person in my community and not using media, maybe later we will use and invite people from local newspaper when we make a new gathering or meeting.'
p660
aS'Exactly, it depend on people because may be bitcoin will not be fine in every business, So the owner will be decided to accept the bitcoin in his business or not. Also we should accept it, not everyone know about bitcoin, only a few country and only a few percentage of the people who using the bitcoin in their business.\xc2\xa0 '
p661
aS'Publicity will help the use of bitcoin locally, followed by the efficient use of the computer system or mobile technology. Internet has being the efficient platform for the use of bitcoin so internet users should encourage the payment or exchange to be mostly bitcoin, then anyone who approaches the internet will get used to it and help local business exchange to adopt bitcoin trade.'
p662
aS'I agree that is mpre on promotion but it is easy to say that. I hope that the consortium also will help addresed this and frequent info drive. Also hope that someone can develop a terminal for bitcoin that like a credit/debit card you just slide your card or you just scan the QR codes o phone and its done. Its easy for the merchant and for buyer too.'
p663
aS"TBH in my country there was a lot of publicity around 2 years ago and a couple of ventures, but the momentum dissipated quickly.If you exclude the online exchanges and local trades done through localbitcoins, there's virtually no market. An ATM for trading bitcoins in my city was even sold to another country..."
p664
aS'i think if this project will be implemented more and more business establishment will start embracing this currency if we can develop a system that will integrate for their business and as an individual holders we should attract more and more of our friends and relatives to learn about btc so the demand of user will push local businesses to embrace it.'
p665
aS"I think that nowdays we don't have to be more active to encourage local businesses to accept bitcoin because now this payment is worldwidely popular and I think good businessman and economist must realize it, more customers = more money. In my country people didn't know much about bitcoin, but local banks made great tread and they made it known for people. Now their action made good things for both, themselves and ourselves."
p666
aS"actually we can't encourage the local businesses to accept bitcoin if we're just actuall small part of the local or such a specific region. we're not really worth it to be accepted the opinion in the eyes of those business owner. doesn't guarantee it will add up their daily earning though. we need many people or just waiting for bitcoin to be popular by itself and we'll just get the good result"
p667
aS"Because lots of people except you is working hard to promote bitcoin.\xc2\xa0 People will never know something unless it is introduced to them.\xc2\xa0 The reason why you know bitcoin because someone introduced it to you, or someone had put an effort to advertise in the web.\xc2\xa0 That's it.things starts in a small group, if it is too tough for you to encourage business owners, then all we can try is to create meet ups with fellow bitcoiner near our neighborhood.\xc2\xa0 Just meet in the same place, until your group is big enough to create an impact or noticeable.\xc2\xa0 As the group grow, the influence will certainly grow.\xc2\xa0 With enough influence, you can then talk to merchant or some business establishment and give your proposal with complete feasibility study and of course with your huge group as support\xc2\xa0 for that new venture of that merchant, there is a big possibility that it will consider the proposal."
p668
aS"Someone has to show them how bitcoin is going to be use and how easy it is to cash it out before we can begin to encourage. That's not even enough. Bitcoin is hard to learn for its something new and regular people afraid of something new especially if they know nothing about it.it has to be on TV before it can spark interset, problem however is that the only way bitcoin can be on TV is that its involvement to illegal stuff."
p669
aS'It\'s not like they\'re doing it altruistically and don\'t have a direct interest in bitcoin. Probably everyone here has a stake in bitcoin and would want the price to increase or at least the daily exchanged volume.Sure but most people only see it as another payment method, so it has to be simple and practical for them otherwise there\'s no point is "wasting" time to set up the essentials'
p670
aS'Go to Your local shop and explain, that You will pay in Bitcoin.Explain too, how time they need waiting for confermations. LOL'
p671
aS"LOL, anyway I think if the support is big enough to make him profit 5x or more if he accept bitcoin then he won't mind the confirmation.\xc2\xa0 What missing in the scene is the number of people willing to do a bitcoin transaction with them.\xc2\xa0 It is obvious that merchants want client, and they are comfortable with the client they have that is using money as mode of payment.\xc2\xa0 If the bitcoin community who introduce the usage of bitcoin will secure that there will be xtimes of client that will use the service. I'm sure merchant will not hesitate to adopt bitcoin a mode of payment."
p672
aS'I have never seen someone, who have asked to pay with bitcoin at the shop.'
p673
aS"Yeah. Pretty sure they would used it as they see bitcoin's platform.Also the advantages that may lead them to build more for their business.Hence, the business economy would be become better and easy as they do a deal to their clients."
p674
aS'That is because bitcoin is not yet being recognized in our local places because most of us who are using are from different parts of the world and we are not close to each other. But if you will be the one to ask the shop to be paid with bitcoins and explain the owners on what are benefits they can get with it.For sure they will be enlightened and will be able to have the encouragement to accept bitcoin.'
p675
aS"well has any Point-of-sale system been proposed for bitcoin so far? pretty sure it'll facilitate bitcoin adoption by local shops, at least if it's cheap"
p676
aS"I don't even know if there are some but if this is going to be proposed to a local stores for sure they will deny it and won't accept this offer. This requires big capital with it and there are some alternative that small stores upon using POS for bitcoin, by accepting directly payment from their bitcoin wallet address. Because not all local stores are that wealthy enough to purchase this kind of software for adoption."
p677
aS'Actually theres no problem regarding on accepting bitcoin on your business even on a small store because they could directly pass bitcoin into your wallet without the need of any software that you mention since bitcoin transactions are irreversible. The main problem here is that the adoption of bitcoin to a certain place thats why some would really refuse to use it since they even heard about it.'
p678
aS'In many countries people have never even heard of bitcoins yet. How do you expect them to accept it when they dont even trust it?Not everyone in the world is having same acumen and they fail to understand the mechanism how the coin works and how it can change the economy. However local businesses prefer local currencies and not bitcoin.'
p679
aS"It is true that bitcoin still need a lot of acknowledgement, but the real problem is how to convince them that bitcoin is a good payment system, most of the time, the news only talk about how a criminal ask for ransom in bitcoin, how people's wallet got hacked, i think we need to convince the local owner that bitcoin is reliable and they can get profit from bitcoin transaction, this need\xc2\xa0 a lot of time, because when we talk about business most of them prefer stability and predictable profit and fiat is more stable than bitcoin and fiat easier to spend"
p680
aS"indeed, bitcoin's volatility is one of the problems, because when you look at it from a local business point-of-view, bitcoin transactions do have lower fees than credit/debit cards fees (they usually have a contract for POS terminals with flat rate/transaction + monthly cost). Even with the slow confirmations bitcoin is faster because they're only credited once a day/week normally."
p681
aS'This thing really bothers most businesses out there that why they dont tend to adopt bitcoin because of price fluctuations. If bitcoin price would be stable i think thats the time they will adopt it because they already know that its not risky already when they are switching.Adoption on this matter would takes time because of some problem they saw on bitcoin.'
p682
aS'I think its pretty difficult to do that, because it has a bad name.The most stores are not convinced by the bitcoin.The first you need to explain and introduce to them what is bitcoin, after that you need to convert bitcoin to fiat every day to state the selling bitcoin price and then does infrastructure for bitcoin payment already available for the storeI think to encourage still need a lot of things to cover and to improve'
p683
aS"There are lots of approach on how to encourage local businesses to accept bitcoin ,We can encourage local businesses by putting less pressure and showing more results. Showing results of the growth of bitcoin and how many people us it.Once they see that they will decide by themselves that's it's a good move to implement bitcoin into their business as payment method."
p684
aS'WOW, what do You call as "growth of bitcoin"?In no one of clients is there with Bitcoin, for what reason "local business" will start to use it?'
p685
aS"That's simple then they will not use it either nor adopt it since no clients are there with bitcoin. But in reality, that is an impossible thing to happen because we can't deny what is the success of bitcoin now. The price is keep on increasing that means the demand is getting higher and many people are already using it. And that can make a local business be encouraged to use bitcoin."
p686
aS'But still it need our hard work to come to the local business we have to take the start to continue the use of bitcoin in our local businesses. we have to start some services like recharging mobile phones or paying bills and have to ask for only bitcoin so for the convenience of paying bills and recharging mobile phones they will try to adopt bitcoin and in this way the success of bitcoin will be promoted among the local marketers .'
p687
aS'The main question is that no one is asking to pay in BTC.For example, i have talked to one guy from NY to sell goods for BTC, he is actually on ebay with 400 products.He have refused this idea on the basis of no requests for that payments.The other thing is hard exchange USD/BTC fluctuations, and he need keep all costs in US $.In this way, try to convert someone in the first person to adopt BTC as payment, and You will see the face of reality.'
p688
aS"BTC must be more promoted and advertised yet to make the negociations easier and more profitable. I wouls say there isn't many people in the world using Bitcoins yet, that is why it's hard to make deals with the coin. If this fact doesn't change, it will continue being hard to buy stuff with BTCs.What can happen, is when the Bitcoin price will become more stable, those guys who fear to lose money exchanging USD/BTC will feel safer to start doing this."
p689
aS'This is not a big problem, anyone can offer the payment via BTC with a price in US $ at the day of purchase.But for small orders the exchange fees becomes big and the profit to buy something expire.'
p690
aS'Local shops are managed by people like me and you. Apparently, these people want to earn money and attract buyers. Perhaps the best way is when we go to the this store to ask seller to pay him with bitcoin. If this is done by several customers for some time he will be forced to learn and accept it as a new payment mean. So more and more local stores see each other will be bitcoin friendly.'
p691
aS'Indeed this is the most difficult thing to do. People are comfortable with fiat and dont really accept bitcoin as a safe and reliable mode of payment, and are not willing to accept it. Most of use have had first impression of bitcoin with dark networks, ransomware, mining botnets and ponzi schemes. So as soon as they hear of bitcoin they have a negative reaction.'
p692
aS"The owner would surely be intrigued about bitcoin when you do that. This is an excellent answer, imo. I've been reading this thread for weeks now and you've got the best answer for me.People fear getting left out. If 5-10 people came to your store asking if you accept bitcoins, you would think that all the other similar stores are accepting bitcoins and you're the only one that doesn't. Without even confirming that thought, you would most probably look up online what is bitcoin and then start accepting it."
p693
aS'I do not think that we have to encourage them honestly we just need to have some patience so the bitcoin can grow more and also used more and more.'
p694
aS"It is basically on the owner's experience and way of thinking. If they are an experimental type of business man then explaining to them what bitcoin can really provide is such an easy task but when it comes to those who are too careful about their business the only thing that could convinced them is that let them experience first what can bitcoin provide."
p695
aS'If you just be patience alone nothing will improve, if the adoption arise only Bitcoin value and demand will increase on it. So try support initialize Bitcoin in their business it would helpful for sure.'
p696
aS"Just the problem about the time, Indian, Russian may some other country will come. The bitcoin will increase for naturally and i think if we can't do anything and just watch it. A lot of the people Indian were following for using bitcoin caused by the disaster of his economic. With all of advantages and bitcoin will spread more and more."
p697
aS"Just to clear what you said. You seem to be saying something about India and Russia here and how bitcoin will be adopted gradually through time.I agree with your statements, Bitcoin will surely be adopted by the world slowly. It would be faster if big corporations like amazon and google implemented Bitcoins. But that's still far off. If small business would help with the adoption of bitcoins, this could be a start for us to grow the number of people using it."
p698
aS'Business wills adopt bitcoin on their own when they see an opportunity to make lots of money, currently this is not the case for most business for the lack of people using bitcoin but this is bound to change.'
p699
aS"No they won't that's why we need to encourage them to use bitcoins especially to the businesses that is near to us. And we can simply tell that bitcoin can boost their sales and another option for their customers to pay with the services or products that they wanted to buy.That is for free if they will just simply adopt bitcoin"
p700
aS"Right,I think those who really uses bitcoin must the one to do business. In this case he will able to encourage people to use btc that can lessen their spends and they'll be able to save. For example id like to establish a service transmitting business using btc wallets."
p701
aS'Usually businesses will think about different type of payment processor just to have more number of customers. Because some people will choose a particular services based on their available payment options. So along with profit making, business owners are mostly looking for customer base.'
p702
aS'The transaction is too slow currently. So it is not good for the adoption of the bitcoin, at least from the time being.'
p703
aS'Its not the case if proper mining fees are paid. However I do accept the fact that the transaction time differences do give other modes of payment an edge over bitcoin payments.Adopting bitcoin in the point-of-sale (pos) may not happen anytime soon in many countries but it will happen maybe in the next 2 decades.'
p704
aS'I will say its not in our place to encourage businesses to accept Bitcoin that is the responsibility of government because how do I begin to start answering the question concerning legality or whether government will wake up and ban the currency or even allow it? Another is the fact that no business owner will want to find himself on the other side of the law.'
p705
aS"Don't always rely to the government for they have a lot of things to fix, poverty, crime and everything. And with this simple encouragement for the bitcoin community you can simply help out those local businesses, small to medium enterprises.The law is just there for legality you can just simply do some research about it if you think that you are violating for teaching businesses to adopt bitcoin."
p706
aS'If you really want to encourage then exert more effort, like you can conduct a free seminar explaining the importance, benefits and advantages of having a bitcoin. Let them see the goodness inside the bitcoin by influencing them, have some testimony why they should try this. '
p707
aS"Well, that's true. But it won't be easy. A merchant consider dead time outside just listening without earning is a waste of time and their loss. The easier approach to that is to come to their place and explain bitcoin slowly so they could understand what really bitcoin is. But never force them to believe you or force them to accept bitcoin, that would just make them think that you are a scammer."
p708
aS'LOLBusiness is about to have profit. No one of them need BTC.What benefit is if no customer will spend BTC?'
p709
aS"It is hard to encourage if the one you are inviting is not open-minded. But we can make it easy if we really know the prospects, we should know who are targets are. Having a business with bitcoin is great because it has unique features that we can't see and use in others. "
p710
aS'Encourage local businesses by explaining to them the benefits of using bitcoins. Businesses might not accept bitcoins unless there is some people will use bitcoins to purchase their goods or services.'
p711
aS'Test it to convert someone, You will see how this is a loss of time and energy.'
p712
aS'I have tried that a few months ago and I found that it require some time to convert her to use bitcoin but it was not the waste of my time and energy as she understood that and now using bitcoin for her different needs of the day.'
p713
aS'No customers with BTC?'
p714
aS'The better strategy would be to convince people/customers to use bitcoins. Businesses just go with the flow of the customers. If they see that customers use bitcoins to pay for goods or they see potential from these customers to use bitcoins as their payment method. If the businesses were the ones who adopt bitcoin then they will just get tired getting people to use bitcoins.'
p715
aS'The petroleum and Gas is payd in US Dollars or in Euro.For this reason there is no space for Bitcoin.'
p716
aS'The question I would like to ask is, "How is it my civic responsibility to determine or even advise local businesses to accept Bitcoin?" I believe that should be the function of government. Aside that talking about local businesses, then it means after explaining Bitcoin to them, then I will need to also show them how to transfer to wallet and the likes but what if they now sell accepting Bitcoin and their own suppliers does not accept, then it means they have to convert to Fiat in which in the process, they might be scammed... And I will be blamed for that... Hopefully government can take the responsibility then I can give support...'
p717
aS"Exactly, someone who is running a business would probably not like to accumulate and hold bitcoins like an individual, but they will have to run their business no matter how, so all they will need are customers and profit out of what they do, they don't need a proof of having a coin is profitable."
p718
aS"Governments don't want to encourage bitcoin adoption at all, in fact they are trying to discourage it by all the possible ways imaginable, they are using the media to misinform the public and make them think bitcoin is only used by drug dealers and people like that."
p719
aS'Does Your local Food Shop or Supermarket accept BTC?'
p720
aS'This is my first time to hear that there is a shop of foods are accepting bitcoin as payment or supermarket are accepting payment with bitcoin, maybe in paris its already accepting it locally or in brazil but i really do not know what exactly shop that accepting bitcoin i heard that coffee shops are accepting bitcoin in some countries.. '
p721
aS'This is a real sign, that for usual people the possess of BTC give no advantages.'
p722
aS"Yes thats really true I don't think what government are trying to do in countries that bitcoins are banned, besides there are big countries accepting it already and they earn a lot also, bitcoin has \xc2\xa0big advantages compare its disadvantages so there's no need to ban the bitcoin. And here in my country I don't really think if there's already a local physical store that accepts bitcoin because its too hard to convinced this local stores owners if they are only thinking that bitcoin is used in drugs transaction."
p723
aS"You can't expect anything from the government. Bitcoin isn't a part of the government and therefore they do not care whatever happen to it. We have to deal with it, bitcoin isn't a government property so expect them not to care about bitcoin or do a favor for it. If it does, for sure it will be to find way to impose tax in it in any way they could and start to watch over its movement in the country. If we want to invite merchants to bitcoin world, we do it ourselves."
p724
aS'Here we are "function of government", there can be many different functions of government besides the conventional ideas that governments should defend the country, the citizens, liberty and property. On of the important functions of government is to establish justice by protecting those that follow the laws, and creating peaceful environment for those people. They are not doing that, most of the countries are corrupted and they think only how to please different corporations.If some local business start to accept bitcoins and skip paying taxes, that business will be closed very fast. Bitcoin is still without any regulations in many countries, but that doesnt mean you can just start using bitcoins in your store without any consequences.'
p725
aS'just tell them a lot about bitcoins'
p726
aS'I think to push local businesses to accept bitcoin on the area the government should legalize bitcoin. Because if bitcoin became legal there certainly local businesses feel safe to accept bitcoin. In addition bitcoin should have a lot to ease adoption. You also have to convince if accept bitcoin will have benefits for the local business.'
p727
aS'Yup, thought to be one of the reasons or to make everyone understand. That to make something according to our good, then we must make something it becomes legal and made safe by everyone. Safely secure what I mean is that it does not exceed the limits of existing laws or safe where everyone could get protection from what they do inside. This also applies for bitcoin, so we should be able to make the Government and the people to support the growth of the bitcoin and make bitcoin became legal throughout the world'
p728
aS'No, I think that\'s not going to happen, and I think we should stick with the present situation...If bitcoin as "legal" means, it will be a biding the law, and that means the government would start to regulate bitcoin... Who knows, merchants might want to use bitcoin too as it is, so why make it legal first? We could try to convince them to use bitcoin, and if they are interested, expect them to ask more, and if they are not, forget it, just leave something to them like bitcoin address along with your contact number or email... Who knows, one day they might change their mind...\xc2\xa0 '
p729
aS'If there is no delivery of goods in BTC, no costs in BTC, why shops will start to sell products in BTC?For creating problems for themself?'
p730
aS"Common people still looks very confused about how bitcoin worksBut with government make it legal and support it , i think it's gonna be the best lesson to know bitcoinAs once bitcoin legalized it's give people a safe feeling to not worrying bitcoin as a scam thingThings will run smoothly if government follows to support bitcoin too i guess."
p731
aS'Not right now.Not entirely true, for example you can go to purse.io and buy things on amazon with a 15% discount that is useful for everyone that makes purchases in amazon, especially in this days where people make lots of last minute purchases.'
p732
aS'We are here about "local business".'
p733
aS'It means Bitcoin reduce the service tax, handling taxes and other particulars when you use Bitcoin any local business. Payment transactions we so convenient when compare with fiat. It would more helpful for overseas trading peoples.'
p734
aS"You're a hero member and by the time that you've spent in this forum, you should know by now that the government will never legalize bitcoin. Legalizing bitcoins means it's okay for them to ditch their own currency.The people that don't feel safe using bitcoin has to do their research. They wouldn't feel unsafe when they know what they're doing. You don't need the government to lecture yourself about these things and no one in this forum has been spoon fed by the government for the very knowledge about bitcoin. We all learned it by ourselves. It's pretty basic once you start reading a couple of articles about bitcoin. "
p735
aS'Not all countries whose governments are declares illegal use bitcoin, there are some countries that legalize bitcoin especially in developed countries. As in the Russian state, previously banned the use of crypto like bitcoin, and even those who violate them will be punished. But last November, Russia officially legalize bitcoin. It proves that the government policy of each country to bitcoin could change. Most importantly how to make bitcoin get confidence in a country. It also will encourage local businesses to accept bitcoin.'
p736
aS"I think even the country doesn't declare it illegal, it doesn't means they declared the Bitcoin legal. The countrie's governments don't say anything about Bitcoins, if they like it, if they endorse this idea... I believe they are just watching the Bitcoin movements to impose a jurisdiction on the moment they can take advantage of it. I would like that things continue as it is now, if Bitcoin becomes legal, it would be worse for us."
p737
aS'It will take time to world fully adopt Bitcoin but the Idea I have to motivate local business to accept Bitcoin that we can simply ask them to accept Bitcoin after buying goods or services from them, for example you stay in a hotel for 3 days you eat various items but when you go to the reception for check out tell them that you do not have cash/debit/credit card because you forgot at home but you have Bitcoin that worth money and \xc2\xa0you want to pay with Bitcoin than the hotel manager will surely accept Bitcoin.How interesting this trick. \xc2\xa0'
p738
aS'Try to made it at Your Supermarket.In a Hotel, they will call the police for sure.'
p739
aS'Will they? What I think about that scenario is that they will put you to jail by not paying your bill and you spent a night there and the following day they will still ask you to pay them with cash, and if you still don\'t then they will file against you, and if you brag about it, well, the state might be your enemy and if it gets worst, they will declare you as "persona non grata"... \xc2\xa0Anyway, if we want to convince those hotel to accept bitcoin, we should start talking to the owner, or the highest official of that establishment, and who knows, they might consider your proposal... \xc2\xa0'
p740
aS"Yes indeed there are countries that declared bitcoin is not illegal and not legal so people allowed to use but must be cautious and if any undesirable it have to be borne alone. But there are some countries which explicitly declares illegal and legalize bitcoin. It depends on each country's policy. Why do not you want bitcoin be legal? Not that it makes it easier the adoption process bitcoin so it will easily grow? But indeed I do not like there will be tax to be paid when a transaction."
p741
aS'Exactly, the first one that must accept bitcoin is the government because it is the one who will legalize to ones country before the local businesses accept the bitcoin as their way of payment. Once the Govt. Make it legalized then it is will easy for the local Business to follow and accept bitcoin without any fear.'
p742
aS"Yeah that is one of the dilemmas a business owner will need to handle. The government can charge than anytime with tax evasion cases just by having Bitcoin with them. But we also have this local Bitcoin Wallet provider in which we have the option to pay our bills online, I don't now their process but it is legal that even electric, internet companies accept the payment. I think it is better that way than the government handling to pass another law for legalizing Bitcoin in their country. "
p743
aS"I think to encourage local businesses accept bitcoin still requires the legality from government. Because it will help local businesses accept bitcoin widely. In my country bitcoin is not illegal and not legal, there is no certainty about the law use of bitcoin but they impose a tax on transactions in the local wallet. It's not fair in my opinion because if the government imposes a tax on local wallet they should also legalize bitcoin. Because if the government legalizes bitcoin bitcoin I believe adoption will increase."
p744
aS"Making the local businesses accept bitcoin will be a hard job. So if there's non then make one yourself. If you have the money make a business that accepts bitcoin even as an alternative payment. First, You should spread it, Start with the people around you. Ask them what business is good these days and smoothly add that you'll accept btc as an alter payment. If you don't have money then just wait for a massive popularity bitcoin bomb in your country."
p745
aS'Well if that local wallet are asking for a tax maybe they are just legal business that they need to pay for a tax.. also for their maintenance of the site.. this is the same as in my country since bitcoin legal but the company which is business is bitcoin service and bitcoin localwallet for it is just a small amount than using other service to other that it needs to pay more fee to be ship your money.. '
p746
aS'Right now only way of encouraging bitcoin in business is in the hands of big offline shops. Let that be a grocery, stationary, food court or anything. Always small shops follow business methods of big shops. So this will encourage the small scale business to use bitcoin in their services as an additional option.'
p747
aS"Earlier I was thinking that it is easy to encourage the people to accept online money directly in bank . But at the current time problem of change of currency in my country ( India) is going on .To complete my daily need I don't have cash than I asked many shopkeeper to accept online bank money but no one was satisfied with me .Now , So how can we encourage to accept Bitcoin , while they are not accepting own local fiat online .I think should not be forced by us . We need to show only our success life to them , So they will attract toward Bitcoin ."
p748
aS'It depends on the government. If the government does not accept bitcoin or does not support it, it is very hard to convince local business to choose bitcoin as a currency. In my region, there is only one shop which allow user to pay by Bitcoin. It is like nightmare here. I love Bitcoin but I do not know how to use it in my country '
p749
aS'It depends from country to country and the interpretation of the law but in my country what it is not forbidden then it\xc2\x92s allowed, since there is not a ban on bitcoin then you can use it freely but you must report your earnings if you sell it but there is no problem to just\xc2\xa0 hold it.'
p750
aS'No it do not depend on the governments but it depends on the people of that country. If people will like to adopt bitcoin and they will like to use bitcoin for their country then they have to promote it to every part of the country and they have to start some services like offline shops in their areas to accept only bitcoin as the payment then everyone will go that way.'
p751
aS"There are many reason to encourage local business to accept btc because till now government are not completely involved in bitcoin, if the shopkeeper is ready to pay taxes means than he is ready to pay tax. So daily bitcoin is emerging to every parts of the country so it will be good to accepts bitcoins at the beginning. Even though bitcoin price is not stag net better if will good for him also because once the price of the bitcoin is increasing definitely he will make more money on it.There is big difference between bitcoin and fiat is fiat will remain the same rate until the governments changes it, where as bitcoin will change it's price without any governments involvement. The value of bitcoin is more compared to fiat currency so in this we have to convince the local business people to accept bitcoin.\xc2\xa0 "
p752
aS'Yes you are right but many people are not believing the bitcoin because of the price variation, only few people are ready to accept bitcoin for thei local business, even we have explained to them lot more about bitcoin. But local business people are afraid because of the government, why means according the user base of the country and their transaction government are charging more on taxes. Once they identify means definitely it will leads to different task so many people are not showing any interest towards it.'
p753
aS'I think this is not depends on the government, we all know there is nothing the government that approves bitcoin, if we are depends to the government of course nobody using bitcoin. We have to be creative so that local businesses can accept bitcoin, simple step is to introduce our business that accept bitcoin, and then we try to do any transaction with bitcoin (send and receive).'
p754
aS"It would really hard to impose bitcoin payments on local merchants specially when government is strict when it comes to taxation and if they knew that you are accepting bitcoin in your business then they might be alarmed that you are evading to pay tax and might not pay the exact amount since they can't know how much did you profits or income."
p755
aS'Accepting bitcoins or real money, tax is no different. The government taxes income the same way. It will just depend if the government will impose a tax on every bitcoin transaction for purchases. But regardless if you use bitcoin or real money, what matter is that someone profited. That profited is taxable. What is hard is convincing people to use bitcoin.'
p756
aS'I hope in most of the commercial businesses could able to accept the bitcoin partially like Amazon doing with purse.io If you have trade with international businesses you could to do payment or transaction via bitcoin. For example, perfume businesses, import and export spices and etc...'
p757
aS'The problem is Purse.io is not affliliated with amazon in anyway. They are just a service that buys whatever you want from Amazon and they pay for it, then the customer pays purse.io. That is so different from paying directly to Amazon, which would be nice if it does happen. Imagine buying things you want from amazon without even using a third party payment processor like purse.io.'
p758
aS"encouraging local businesses to accept not only bitcoin but some other worthy cryptocurrency seems not to be so hard nowadays, it is due to the innovations and the influence of the information technology and the help it will bring to everyday's life.for someone who can show the advantage of the information technology, he or she can easily encourage the business owner to accept or use bitcoin into his or her business."
p759
aS"If you are talking about innovations and technology, I guess that is going to be an advantage and good front liner for those local business that wants to adopt modern technology. Since everything has been now improving by means of tech, its going to be an easy thing if you are going to explain how bitcoin and crypto's are working that can help their business to boost, locally, globally and online."
p760
aS'It would really be helpful and you are right business nowadays and their owners are already aware regarding on the tech that is being developed on this era and we could say that they could easily understand if we tend to explain to them about bitcoin but the big question is the adoption of bitcoin on the place on where those businesses located.'
p761
aS"Unless your area has a big amount of users of bitcoin I don't see a lot of businessmen adopting bitcoin because it is not going to make sense to accept this new currency if no one is using it."
p762
aS"That's why it is not going to be hard enough especially if you have enough knowledge in bitcoin even the simplest one. And you just need to explain what is bitcoin, how to obtain and use bitcoin. That is a very easy thing, the only problem is that we know that businessmen are not interested if there is no user in his place except from you."
p763
aS"i don't think that we can help them, they have to decide on their own"
p764
aS"Yes we can, we can encourage them. We can explain them what are the benefits, like those related to taxes or that they will maybe easier find bitcoin investors then fiat investors or that with using bitcoins they could be more competitive. There are risks too, ofw course, but it's worth trying."
p765
aS'Suggesting is the only thing we can do in that case, because a local business would only start accepting bitcoins if they see any progress of bitcoin around them, and for that they should know at least a few people around which are interested in using or spending bitcoins so that they can add bitcoin to their payment systems, otherwise they wont look it as a good idea.'
p766
aS'Yeah and it is not that easy as we think to spread the news about bitcoin in your community if you are the only user that can be found there.And those businessmen will not believe in this project if only people are using it way back then.But if we can see the situation now, if you will just show them what is the value of bitcoin then it can get their interest after all.'
p767
aS'About what "value" are You talking now?'
p768
aS"I'm talking about the price of bitcoin there. Because if those businessmen will see the price/value of bitcoin today.It can make them encourage that bitcoin is really a real currency that can be used for good whether you are transacting with merchants or other user."
p769
aS'We can help them, we just need to explain to them on how bitcoin can be good to their business and how it can boost their sales. Especially if their business is an online business, their transactions can be on instant and while bitcoins is in their wallet. The chance of getting higher profit as the price increase is happening, it can give them another opportunity.'
p770
aS'Interestingly I have convinced my local shopkeeper to start accepting bitcoin payments, but unfortunately he is not finding many bitcoin payments and no significant improvements in sales. This may be due to lack of bitcoin adoption in my area and also even some people are adopting bitcoin still they are not ready to spend bitcoins right now.'
p771
aS'feels like it is still 2013'
p772
aS'Except there are more stores that accept bitcoin, and more lunatic bitcoin enthusiast than before\xc2\xa0 .\xc2\xa0 It is still not easy to convince people to establish business and accept bitcoin as payment.\xc2\xa0 The high volatility is the culprit behind this hardship in my opinion.'
p773
aS"That's good to know if you had convinced your local shopkeeper, don't worry it is a step by step process. So the next thing that you need to do is advertise and let those customers know that the shop that you are sharing knowledge about bitcoin is already accepting it. It may took a little time before those customers will have total adoption in bitcoin but what is important that you already advertise bitcoin to them."
p774
aS"That doesn't give any sense, why would a business care for the price of a coin if they want to use it or not? They wont get anything extra for using bitcoin no matter what is its price. If they are selling shoes then they will just get the payment for that, no matter if you pay it with bitcoins or dollars you will have to give the same price for that."
p775
aS"What? You don't have an idea regarding business profit pricing and everything? Business will care about a price of a coin.Because they are a profitable establishment that aims for profit so that they can keep on operating.They will get something extraordinary upon acceptance of bitcoin, it is a matter of uniqueness."
p776
aS'Like PayPal if they could announces or paste they avcoets bitcoins means its really amazing and people who uses bitcoin will utilise it for sure. But due to idiot government we any small businesses or grocery could do that easily.'
p777
aS'For sure, it provide suicides, when the exchange rate go down at 80% in few days.There are no people who will have such risky currency in hands.Business people need a stable currency, such fluctuations are unaccettable.In normal way they exchange BTC to $ or \xc2\x80 at the same moment of payment in BTC.'
p778
aS"Yes you are right but we can help them by explaining them what are the uses of bitcoins there are many local businesses dont know about bitcoins so we can help them by our suggestions it's up to them if they are really convinced for your suggestions."
p779
aS'Even if you can encourage them to accept Bitcoin, how can you able to change the government rule. I mean, In my country, the government has promulgated restrictions on Bitcoin and other currencies and warn the people the Bitcoin is dangerous which can steal people money. Because of those rules, Bitcoin can not be used here. '
p780
aS'This thread has gone full retard with posts and ideas being repeated over and over. Lets all face it ladies and gentlemen, convincing local businesses to accept BTC in a massive scale that would matter is a lost cause. Convincing illegal online businesses to accept BTC on the other hand, is a different story.'
p781
aS'Absolutely right we really can help them actually through our explainations but its really hard to teach them if no proof at all right? So to begin explaining them the btc reality we must have our visual aids like presentation of bitcoin history and until at present days btc influences a lot of people who are brilliant with their visions. We must have records of activities we did online and include it in our presentation files to be having complete, brief and trusted information and of course the sincerety of what you will be explaining to those local businesses owners.'
p782
aS'Those visual and other stuffs will really help you out on convincing but besides on bringing those tools its better to show them off a full and precise explanation of bitcoin through video because its somehow effective on explaining on precise way and bring some little examples to demonstrate to him on its usage then he might got interested on that but still depends on the knowledge of business owner into digital stuffs.'
p783
aS'im always asking "are you accepting btc?" to all shops in Turkey. but sometimes staffs are know what is btc. we need more academic presentation. if everyone knows, they accept it. we need to spread it.'
p784
aS'And no one will have do do with BTC.'
p785
aS'If the bitcoin price rises to $5000, most people in the world will know about Bitcoin. Attention chases money.'
p786
aS'Businesses owners prefer to stay out of trouble, if you begin to say to them they can avoid taxes with bitcoin they are going to avoid bitcoin even more since they prefer to pay their taxes than to risk their investment in their business.'
p787
aS'This is not exactly true, in a more wider scale. I think its the spreading and the innate acceptance which draws people to bitcoin along with the advantages it gives. Its not always about money/price of bitcoin and rarely "acceptance" is due to `attention chasing money`.If people believe that bitcoin can be a better alternative to fiat and that the advantages of bitcoin can overcome the disadvantages of fiat only then they will accept it and else not.You cannot lure people with money into accepting something - you will be accused as a scammer if the project failed in the long run.'
p788
aS'If they know it and see the advantages of the bitcoin you already do not need them to convince them anymore.'
p789
aS'my aim is just let people hear "bitcoin". maybe they are curious about that and looking for "bitcoin".'
p790
aS'Its more like the business owners dont need to accept BTC. Accepting fiat and credit cards works fine and smoothly for them so why is there a need add BTC. How will that be an advantage to them? All the Bitcoiners in this thread doesnt even spend that much in BTC anyway. '
p791
aS"to accept credit cards they have to rent equipment, pay higher fee rates and most importantly, have to wait for the payment processor to credit their account, since payments don't go directly from the customer to the owner's bank account."
p792
aS'Thats not a problem. They pass the payment of these fees to the customers. Ever wonder why the stores give you a discount whenever you pay them in cash? Its not really a discount. Its the real price. You pay more when you use your credit card because it is you who pay for the fees themselves.'
p793
aS'Not all of the local businesses know about Bitcoin and for encouraging it in our local businesses we have to take the start. If you start a local shop in your area with discount and attract the buyers to you then people will come to you and other store owners will also start to accept bitcoin.'
p794
aS'Do You starting some business?Why You have a idea to use a discount model of shop? Are You living in a ghetto?'
p795
aS'I think it is hard to attract them if they know the benefits of bitcoin and how to use it maybe they can accept it as payment method but it is depends what is their business or product they are offering..\xc2\xa0 if bitcoin will fit for their business maybe they can attract more people to use it with special offers or discounts,. '
p796
aS'People often like to go to those shops which provide discounts to its clients.According to my experience with bitcoin I think every business best fit the use of bitcoin as its payment system for their clients. If a person start a shop with bitcoin and will provide discount and along with that if the shopkeeper will provide unique products then people will adopt bitcoin. With that at least the people around you and other shops will know about bitcoin and as everyone here know that bitcoin is more convenient currency so after knowing about it anyone like to adopt it. '
p797
aS"The problem is not all people know about bitcoins, even in my area only 1-2 people know about bitcoin. Before we encourage local businesses to use bitcoin, we need to introduce them first about what and how is bitcoin works. I'm sure they will start using bitcoin if the buyer want using bitcoin as the payment."
p798
aS'How do You immagine the process?Someone will exchange local money to BTC and spend them on goods at the shop?'
p799
aS'I dont know what he meant by that but i would like to ask if that thing would succesfuly work by just someone tend to pay bitcoin for the goods he bought and we all know that not all business owners would easily accept it specially if they dont have enough knowledge or idea on such thing like bitcoin.Encouraging would really be hard.'
p800
aS'Just go to explain the time for confermations, and wait how long they will need for start kicking you in ass from the shop.'
p801
aS"don't know where you live but having been on multiple european countries that's not really the case, although many have a minimum purchase amount for paying with cc.Also if they're giving you a discount when paying with cash its mostly because they're probably not going to register that sale and pay the corresponding tax.."
p802
aS'That suggestion is laughable, honestly. Have you seen Jehovah\'s witnesses knocking house to house and then get rejected all of the time? A lot of people have made jokes about them. That\'s how foolish you would look like when you try and talk to people house to house. What are you going to do? Knock at a stranger\'s house and say, "Hi. Do you know bitcoins? Bitcoin is a decentralized crypto-currency blah blah...."  Moreover, people won\'t just let you in inside their house for some knowledge that they can be well-versed of in just a matter of minutes of searching on google.'
p803
aS"That's indeed a joke and stupid way to inform people about bitcoin, only inform those who's really interested and just leave the rest, no enforcement to the people who don't interested and no disturbing them is a must for the sake of informing about bitcoin, otherwise it will be really annoying for them. Today everyone can just find an information through internet with ease and there's no point of wasting time and energy to do such useless thing"
p804
aS"In what European countries do they avoid paying sales tax? Thats Europe, they dont condone such practices. Maybe you are from a third world country where avoiding taxes is rampant because your government is very inefficient in collecting them.It is a known fact that the consumers themselves pay for the credit card fees. So I dont know what planet you're from."
p805
aS'bitcoin should have faster transaction confirmations and lower fees for many businesses to even consider adopting it. it should give more convenience rather than more hassle to adopters. until that is achieved fiat will still be king. '
p806
aS"Have you tried it, though?  Probably not.I'm not thinking like that because I haven't done it before. I'm thinking what if someone goes knocking around the neighborhood, I thought that I would laugh when I saw someone doing such effort just to introduce bitcoins when he can simply post it on facebook where the message can reach more people. If your message really is persuading, then your post might even get shared by other people.The difference of religion and business has nothing to do with this. The point is the idea of going house to house just to talk about some topic that can easily be found on the internet is absurd."
p807
aS'There is a guarantee that bitcoin can have faster transaction but when we talk about confirmations, the problem is existing there.And the fees are good to be considered by those local business because they just need to pay the miners fee and they are free of taxing.I guess that can easily encourage them if they are going to know that bitcoin is free of tax but for sure they will have doubt because they might violate law about taxation.'
p808
aS"Although house to house visit and sharing knowledge about bitcoin can truly helps but theres no guarantee at all bitcoin is totally unknown for everybody who's not really unto online world and surely people will think that we are recruiting them to the networking kind of scene where they surely not trusting it, and also i think the best one to market bitcoins is by word of mouth by people who experience it well and teach it to the nearest kin or neighboorhood or even by placing ad on some crowded place and surely by that many people and business establishment will notice of that existince."
p809
aS'I dont what your problem is but if you dont like to encourage the use of bitcoins then rather than posting sh$t in the forum go get a life. Bitcoin is being gradually accepted throughout the world. You can think that one fine day you will wake up to find every user to be a bitcoin adopter.As gradually people want bitcoin as payment, local markets will be forced to implement it as a payment method is their Point-of-sale (POS). In that way with time the local shops will show bitcoin acceptance.'
p810
aS'Actually that member do not have much knowledge about bitcoin and do not know much about other features of bitcoin that is why just thinking about the confirmation time. That member even do not know that nowadays even 1 confirmation is enough which often take a fraction of a minute.'
p811
aS'Do You have around You some supermarket who have realized that?In place where i live people prefer cash and in some cases they are accepting CC.'
p812
aS"We can speak to them and explain how bitcoins work and what bitcoins can do. There are some people were not familiar with bitcoins they think it's a scam."
p813
aS'It\'s not going to be easy, you need to be very quick at explaining since businessmen want a quick "short but brief" explanation when they are being told about money, they don\'t want to hear bullshits and shady things about a thing. I think we need to put it in a power presentation and just leave it to them with some notes in it, for them to read it and decide to themselves. One feature that you could tell them is what OP mentioned, it\'s one way, once paid, it can\'t be return unless the receiver decides to. It favor the merchants against those silly customers.'
p814
aS'The thing is you are doing anything for it to make those people encourage and as long as you did your job on letting them know what bitcoin really is. And there are some people who are truly looking into an effort of someone that wants to help them with this type of financial ways. Even though everything can be search it out with google still, talking personal to them will be an effective way.'
p815
aS'I guess it does not need to be encouraged. for people using bitcoin, or for those who know to use bitcoin, they will accept it at local businesses they create. using bitcoin emblem in the business they do, will give a signal for bitcoin users to be able to know that local businesses that accept bitcoin'
p816
aS'That is true, but the thing is if why a local business would adopt bitcoin if they does not even know that there are any bitcoin users around them to use bitcoin in their services? So a local business would only get encouraged if they see some people using or having bitcoins around them so that they can come to know they will have some basic customers around them.'
p817
aS"It is a risk that those business owners will not going to take. Even how good the market of bitcoin worldwide and how its price is being good and stable landing at $800 but if that person is just owning a small store that is just hoping to have some good customers by simply paying him cash will satisfy him. And he won't even bother and waste his time for knowing who are those bitcoin users around him."
p818
aS'Thats not only the reason because most of them doesnt really know about bitcoin and if they knew it then they would probably refuse to accept too because we all know that bitcoins price is too unstable which means they may gain or profit and that depends on the movement of bitcoins price.Its really hard for them to convince actually.'
p819
aS'We can encourage businesses to use it if they know how it work and if they know that you can make big profits by just using it already, some will look into it immediately.'
p820
aS"Having not enough knowledge in bitcoin is just a normal thing for those business owners, don't expect that they have knowledge with it already. That's why we need to do something in able to encourage them and put their interest into bitcoin. Maybe fronting that bitcoin is a good investment and can generate good profit will encourage them."
p821
aS'LOL, try to supply them items in BTC.I will see, how You will be able to change the interest from the profit to BTC.All the bills are in local currency, just no one sell fuel in BTC.Who will have the currency exchange risks for free?'
p822
aS'This can be an option but its also not easy to do and it will also need you to invest in them and I think that is not the point of this.I think that they have to know how its working and why its profitable.'
p823
aS'Where is the profit?In currency risks?People love the stability.Who need so unstable currency in business life to deal?'
p824
aS'We can do that by offering them bonus over their profit and making it easier for them to organize their documentation and setting up everything-that would be pretty great'
p825
aS"TIL fraud doesn't exist! Thank you pinkflower for your insight! although i'm suspecting your name is some euphemism related to your level of expertise (or lack thereof) about SME/companies and society in general."
p826
aS"No, you can't just simply supply them items in bitcoin. You just need to explain to them and prove that bitcoin is real and with that, it's up to them if they are going to get interested with it. We don't have to force them even though you are right their about currency exchange, everyday there is a risk and we can't guarantee it to them to be free."
p827
aS'If wanting more from your local community, it can surely be beneficial to start a Bitcoin Vending company to introduce it into local consumption. Without effort nothing can start off until momentum builds, so continue pushing to newcomers so eventually something can develop around you.Proper expansion can do good, but sometimes digital services could become something better if establishing hybrid ideologies when consuming.'
p828
aS"This is brilliant, why would we need to encourage local businessmen to start accepting bitcoin if we ourselves could start it out by spreading bitcoin to the locals by putting up a vending company/machines that accepts bitcoin and probably a vending machine where we can buy bitcoin...Waiting for merchants to accept bitcoin would be longer if we ourselves won't start it out and be a merchant, by selling things and accepting bitcoin... We all know that it's hard to convince business stabllishments to use bitcoin if they don't know it and it's not being advertised by local mainstreem medias, so the best way would be to start it ourselves...\xc2\xa0 "
p829
aS"What's the point of having so much bitcoin in the market without any place to spend it. There would be just money without anyone accepting that money. Think about it, what if you and I make our paper money. We print our faces on it and put some symbols and words on it that would make it look like some sort of paper money from a foreign country. No one would accept it. Because no one else values it but us two. That's the same concept for bitcoins."
p830
aS'I agree on your statement but seeing the status of bitcoin it is gradually being adopted which means its not useless and limited for some only.It may not be available or adopted worldwide but still its shows progress and potential which most users of bitcoin is wishing on.Spending our bitcoin without the need of exchanging it to fiat is really great.That time will come for sure.'
p831
aS"already certain that growth will be higher and bitcoin will increasingly give advantage to us already from the beginning to keep some bitcoin that we have now. So, this is not bullshit. But it is indeed a fact, if you don't believe me then look at some State or ask some of the people around you who know the internet very well. then their answers will be very good and will definitely know the bitcoin. Now that it's been a lot of media attention in the bitcoin. Just waiting for the right time in the implementation of the growth of the bitcoin\xc2\xa0"
p832
aS"I don't think you can just apply that analogy to bitcoins. Creating a fake fiat money is not the same thing as a cryptocurrency. 2 people is far from an approximate of million bitcoin users all around the world. Crypto has an exchanger and you can quickly find the current price of the coin. Some coins might not be personally valued that much by other people, but they still have a fiat value. Good example is bitcoins. A non-bitcoin user would be surprised if someone gave him a physical bitcoin that has an address with 1 BTC in it when he checked the price online.I have news for you. You can convert bitcoins to fiat! Seems to me that you didn't know."
p833
aS"We just need to encourage them to use the bitcoin more and more, I'm pretty sure that we can encourage them by motivating them and tell them they can make profit and can accept it easily."
p834
aS"That is very hard bro, you can't just tell them like that, its a business and all business man/woman cares a lot for this business and especially bitcoin price is very volatile. You can't just tell them that if you use bitcoin you can make profit, how come if the price go down like this time. Accepting bitcoin for local that don't know the disadvantages of it can make their business lost."
p835
aS'For this exist bitpay.com, but supermarkets and other stores seems have no fun to entroduce it.Put the price in local currency and accept $ trough bitpay.comSeems this is too much work.'
p836
aS'Good idea but I think if you want to encourage them by motivating them you will need a lot of time to explain what are the benefits of bitcoins and bitcoins can do. They are businessman so you will need\xc2\xa0 to brief them more about bitcoins.'
p837
aS'another ways of encouragement is by letting them see the benefits of using Bitcoins, tell them that bitcoin doesn\'t needs more papers as transaction records, what they needed is just the internet connection. you can even say that bitcoin is a part of innovations and new technologies that attracts more customers and investors especially those "techies" and the youth which are hooked at the digital innovations.'
p838
aS'How is that an advantage of bitcoin over paper money? Paper money don\'t need transaction records too and it doesn\'t even require Internet connection. You just give him your paper money, he says "Thank you.", he hands you the item, and then that\'s it. A bitcoin transaction would require a mobile phone, scanning QR code, and then putting the amount of bitcoins, and then waiting for an average of 10 mins for the transaction to get processed. Not to mention if the location of the shop doesn\'t have Wi-Fi, in a remote area, or doesn\'t have a good signal reception.That would work. People want to be "in". People want to follow the trend. Simply saying that it\'s the "thing" right now will get them hooked in the idea.'
p839
aS'This is good for merchants and small entrepreneurs. But still it is not all about having fun, business is business when an owner sees that he is going to get more profit with it then he will grab the opportunity and accepts bitcoin instantly. It is just a matter of good talks and drinks and for sure you can convince them no matter how long it will take.'
p840
aS'Value stability !Most people will avoid risky investment , people will use currency that have stable valueGoverment support !When goverment made bitcoin as legal currency , bitcoin usage will increase ( for public and for personal usage )'
p841
aS"We can't just shove it up their throats just like that, it must be a slow adoption so that the public will know it's benefits. Like a store at a time and a customer at a time then it will exponentially grow. We must first target small businesses that would accept bitcoin payments. Probably the best ones that would accept bitcoins are techstores. "
p842
aS'If majority of the people will used the bitcoin in transaction. We can assure and prove to other people that bitcoin is really the fastest way to transact especially in buisness. Not just that ,the value of \xc2\xa0bitcoin can increase dramatically in less than a minute. It just need proper managing .'
p843
aS'The biggest question there is\xc2\xa0 "HOW"? we can\'t even convince our partners and friends in real life to use it, how will we convince others to use bitcoin. With that, I could say that merchants that accepts bitcoin will play a great role in spreading bitcoin, they should be the people where we should introduce bitcoin. I am sure that it\'s not easy, usually a businessman are old people in the society, therefore it\'s hard to convince them with just bubbling words.'
p844
aS'To be honest both of the above mentioned things are NEVER going to happen to bitcoin.Value will not become stable simply because the sheer number of traders of bitcoin are too many and there is always the regular pumping and dumping occurring that makes prices volatile.Governments are actually against bitcoin. Many country governments have already banned bitcoin. SImply because the banks help taxation which is a good source of income of the government. It is good but bitcoin being decentralized, there is no one to regulate taxes like that until some enforcing is done in the proper place.'
p845
aS"You can try to create conventional videos on how bitcoin will work for their businesses. Don't forget to include the benefits of using bitcoin and how it is so efficient to be used as a payment for POS. So in that way, it will be presented in rich form than using any basic techniques like word of mouth. And I believe they will be more persuaded by using virtual materials than just speeches which makes it boring in listening only.And in presenting video I guess better to make something memorable to the audience and more on the advantage on how they will be benified on using it.Graphic material is an alternative too. Print useful documents that explains the use of bitcoin."
p846
aS'We can encourage them by let them experiment with it, let them test it and than they will soon or later gonna sue it for sure.'
p847
aS'No We cant encourage them by experiment with it. If i am a business man, I want to have an advantages to encourage me to use this bitcoin. But How will you encourage me? What is the best advantages using this coin? The price of this coin is not stable so if they pay using this bitcoin, and the price decrease i will lose some profit. Thats not good in business '
p848
aS'It depends on the location, there could be zones where there is a high concentration of bitcoin users and in those places it could be profitable to accept bitcoin in your business.'
p849
aS"You don't have to cash out when the price has decreased. You can always wait for a few more months before cashing out and that would give you profit. All of these is just a seasonal thing. There are times when bitcoin's down, and there are times when bitcoin's up. Just convert your coins when the price is much higher than when you acquired those coins and you'll be fine.But if you're still worried that some emergency might be in the way that would force you to cash out at a price dip, then just convert the coins to fiat right when you received it."
p850
aS"No it's not right to let them experiment because businessman have no ide what bitcoins are but you can explain them instead of let them experiment they also need a basic explaination."
p851
aS'But in business they need the payment immediately to use in their businesses, and sometimes the price is not stable so even if you convert it immediately the payment is not current sometimes it higher or it lower. And if you are the businessman, if your customers pay you now, then the payment does not reach the capital and you need to buy another product because you already sell your item at deficit price. What will you do? you will loan? or you will convert it ?'
p852
aS'People like to be a part of innovation, but when it comes to reality they prefer fiat as its easy and accessible everywhere. No limitations that it needs to have technical knowledge or something. Bitcoin is not like that, simply describing it an innovation and making people start to use it is really not possible. The people who already know about it when starts using into businesses it easily gains the attention.'
p853
aS'And who is going to pay them remittance or bear the jail when the experiment turns to a scam one?Many people have organised such scam events in order to make people buy bitcoins for them and then they ran away with their money. Even the sales organizers were not aware that it was a scam and got beaten up by the public.Organizing a mass advertisement campaign for local businesses is not an easy job. You have to make them accept it.'
p854
aS'A way to encourage business will be be trying to get more people involved in bitcoin within your community explain them what advantages they can get out of bitcoin and if they like it then they will adopt bitcoin and eventually business will begin to adopt it.'
p855
aS'Simple words of explanation is not going to be enough to make those business owners encourage for using bitcoin. You need to do a lot of things so that they can consider your explanation is a tough one and believable. So, upon explaining what are the advantages of bitcoin, you also need to include some proof of your profit with it.'
p856
aS'First question is why would people use bitcoin in transaction? Bitcoin is not fastest way, and bitcoin price has nothing with selling goods, they have their own price and that price doesn`t depend from bitcoin. Second question is what you think what kind of managing do we need? Local business need legality and stability, what is someone sell all store for bitcoins and the next day bitcoin price drops significantly, merchant will lose a lot, and he will lose business cause he will not be able to order new stuff. I think local businesses need stability, they will not risk their money and wealth just like that.'
p857
aS'Very easy.Merchants want one simple basic thing : sellProvide them a device that integrate bitcoin acceptance, basic and simple to use, no hassle and instant conversion to Fiat deposited the next day and you will see them adopt Bitcoin as fast as VISA/Mastercard.'
p858
aS'Yes we can encourage local businesses to accept btc, and before that\xc2\xa0 you should be able to orient the one who managed or owns the business. You will be explaining the to him or her the importance and advantages of bitcoin to the market today and its impact if they adopt it with selling their goods. So first of all you should make the owners of the local business to learn a lot of strategy on how they will earn good profit through bitcoin if they used this as a mode of payment although bitcoin price is fluctuating and not stable, there maybe times of peak price so that thing should be learned by those business holders.'
p859
aS'I think in explaining it to a newbie, we should make it short but brief, and just let them explore bitcoin by themselves...As much as possible we should not sugarcoat what we are saying about bitcoin,t should be something realistic... When we are talking about the price fluctuation, I think we should show some chart to them, so they know, and see what is their impression about the price... But we should\xc2\xa0 not force them to accept bitcoin, it is not their obligation to accept bitcoin and its their choice whether they will try it or not...\xc2\xa0 '
p860
aS'Lets say you succesfully convinced the owner on accepting bitcoin on to your place but the adoption of bitcoin on there is almost zero then it would be useless but still you could able to benefit that since you do have a bitcoin to spent on that store but well its still okay because people would find it no matter what and got curios about it and would tend to know what is bitcoin.'
p861
aS"I agree but there are chances may be we can provide some training to newbie who don't have any knowledge about bitcoin with free of cost, in this way we can make people motivate what are the advantages of using bitcoin. We have to explain from basis so that they will understand how this can helpful to grow their business. "
p862
aS"There are so many educational videos about bitcoin already that it hurt to watch them all since they would not anymore give new information about bitcoin if you were to watch one video. I don't think teaching more newbies about bitcoin would be the jump off point of bitcoin being a currency people would accept in their businesses."
p863
aS'You are so naive and simple. If it were as easy as that it would have happened already. Cant you just accept that no merchant wants to accept BTC except for a very minute minority? I dont know where you are from or what your level of education is but your answer tells a whole lot about you.'
p864
aS'Having merchants have a bitcoin payment processor in truly not the answer. Like hat pinkflower said, if it was that easy then there is no point in the discussion. Every merchant would have opened a bitcoin channel where he can accept payments. Bitcoin needs to be adopted in a way that it would introduce every great aspects it has. People should believe in it and realize what it can do before it gets adopted by merchants and consumers.'
p865
aS'It is good to know that there are some people who is trying to make this kind of move despite the fact that it is hard to encourage the local business to have this in their stores.And so for me, I guess show them what are the advantages of having this on their store.'
p866
aS'It is really hard to encourage local businesses to engage themselves with bitcoin. Since it is still kind of new and young, those businessmen will not going to believe us immediately. But it depends on how we are going to explain things and how they will benefit from using bitcoin. I believe that they will just going to get excited with the convenience and profit.'
p867
aS'It is not easy as that,\xc2\xa0 dig deeper on why merchant wanted to sell.\xc2\xa0 It is the profit.\xc2\xa0 As long as the scenario bring profit to the merchant, there is no second thought that they will accept bitcoin.\xc2\xa0 Aside from that, merchants also care on the stability of the currency they will be using.\xc2\xa0 Organization can supply them all the gadgets for bitcoin merchant start-up but the most concern will be the price of Bitcoin in between the selling and cashing out.'
p868
aS'If any of the Ecommerce site accepting bitcoin as payment for the consumers and dealers. Dealers who is tied up with the Ecommerce site would be helpful for the small scale business people with the bitcoin payment.'
p869
aS'Merchants are probably not waiting for a device which can integrate bitcoin acceptance, they want customers. If they want one basic thing which is selling then for selling they would probably need customers, so if they even have the device but not bitcoin customers then the device is of no use.'
p870
aS'Besides is the fact that there are still aspects that developers should improve such as ease of use, as well as that if someone needs to acquire BTC to buy other goods in stores it will be more expensive to do so than buying directly with the traditional media, so for the common customer is not very attractive to perform and maybe that is another reason where local businesses \xc2\xa0are not very interested in that matter yet, perhaps over time the rate of\xc2\xa0 conversion will be lowered and\xc2\xa0 then one could speak of a greater use by such businesses but I repeat, for now it does not seem to be the case maybe in a couple of years things are a little different of what they are now.'
p871
aS"Merchants don't need to keep bitcoin if they don't wish to expose themselves to the volatility of the market they could always sell their coins immediately after getting a purchase."
p872
aS"Yes, in theory that should work but I also think that it also depends a lot on the size of the merchants and the volume they handle, to cite an example, let's suppose that a large merchant sells ten thousand usb \xc2\xa0when price BTC is on $900, if the price falls that same day $50 then he will suffer a loss according to the number he has sold and paid him \xc2\xa0with BTC, and it's what you mention he should have sold immediately, but what if his sales were made in 20 hours almost all day, talking about an online store for example, the seller can not be changing his BTC \xc2\xa0every moment,so it could have to wait for at least one day to make the change, but do not know if the price will go up or down, it went up more than $900, He will be happy and will do the exchange, but what happens in the opposite case, that is to say that the price goes down, He will have to wait until the price recovers in the best of cases or sell at a loss which would be very bad for the business, and here you start to see why not many businesses still accept it as payment."
p873
aS'Most business are not in the market for innovation they are there to make money and as such they will try trusted and proven methods, bitcoin is a great innovation but I\xc2\x92m sure many businessmen will not consider it for now simply because it is too new.'
p874
aS'Bitcoin need popularity first in the area before merchants consider to use it. yes it will be hard to convince them to use btc as payment method but if they came to know what convenience can btc bring in their business they might become interested.'
p875
aS'Real understanding about its potential is much needed for a person before implementing bitcoin into any sort of business. In the past more merchants ignore bitcoin just because of its high volatile nature, now volatility have decreased alot. So soon we can expect more stores as well malls accepting bitcoin as a payment.'
p876
aS'I think it depends on the marketing strategy, whatever we do good marketing strategy if they will accept it gladly include the problem of payment accept bitcoin.'
p877
aS"Whatever strategy you use to make local merchants like bitcoin, it won't work if they are not interested in it. If you force it, probably\xc2\xa0 you would look suspicious to them. It would be nice to just let them naturally know bitcoin. Introduce it to everyone but never expect that they will all like bitcoin. The best thing is you did what you think could make them like bitcoin.\xc2\xa0 "
p878
aS"Marketing strategy really matters but how you are going to market something that it isn't used by the citizens on an area? That's a tough challenge for us if we are going to think realistic, that's the first thing that will come to the mind of the business owners. But if you are going to answer this, you better encourage your neighbors to use bitcoins before encouraging the local business owners."
p879
aS"In fact the local businesses even think that we are trying to lure them into some money laundering scheme. Many people's first exposure to bitcoin was ransomware and uTorrent coin mining malwares, drug dealers, Silk route incidents.They still think that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme and are not willing to accept it into the business no matter what."
p880
aS"Of course bitcoin is definitely a scam related coin. Even fiat is a scam related coin. Every single currency have been used for scams or other shady activities.The people that think bitcoin is a huge ponzi scam should do their own research because they obviously have no idea of what bitcoin is.The scams online shouldn't discourage local businesses at all since they are sure that they're not going to be scammed since the payment is not reversible. The local business owner doesn't have to send first. He should require to send payment first before he gives the item."
p881
aS'Well firstly show them how they can gain easy profit on it and how to use this crypto-currency You can tell them how quick and easy is bitcoin to tranfer and send money without any information required not like paypal.'
p882
aS"Well it's hard to change their minds when most news either about bitcoin's price or ransomware demands."
p883
aS'If they will be real merchants and they will know about business then they will not consider bitcoin as ponzi but they will know about the concept of demand and value and they will know that the value of a currency increases and decreases with demand so they will accept it.'
p884
aS"Thats true businessman looks a how they can make money on their business so we need a representative from Bitcoin that can talk to them to accept Bitcoin to they didn't think that Bitcoin is only a ponzi scheme."
p885
aS'to encourage local businesses to use bitcoin, bitcoin I think you should explain to them, the same as is done by people before, such as in the documentary, the rise of bitcoin. if you do not want that, you just need to show an example to build a business that accepts bitcoin and fiat.'
p886
aS"It a must to encourage them, let them know what bitcoin is and explain things that they don't know about it. But this is not an easy task.As a lot of people are still doubtful for it mainly the businessmen and it is really going to be a tough one on encouraging them using bitcoin.Showing them a proof can help to encourage them but locally they must be bitcoiners that are nearby to his business.As business that needs to have profit so if there are no bitcoiners near him, his business that accepts bitcoin will be forgotten."
p887
aS"It's not that easy guys. Yes, the online merchants can accept BTC, but most of the offline merchants can't because of several reasons. First - the invoicing system is not supported by BTC in most countries which have a fiscal cash register (cash register connected to the tax system from the goverment), which means that you can't issue an invoice for BTC-s, e.g. you're avoiding the taxes and your business is ilegal. Second - the book keeping systems do not accept BTC, which means you have to transfer your BTC to your currency to actually go through the papersThird - the workers do not accept BTC, mostly because of security (credit cards, loans, payment information, credit score), so, again, you need to transfer it to your currency and pay out the salariesFourth - it's in the merchants best interest to keep his money on the bank account, in case a problem occures, he can always go for a loan or a smaller late paymentI still have problems explaining my book keeper and the goverment what PayPal invoices are, and only god knows how it would be if I would want to explain her BTC. I personally didn't come up with a solution for a legal offline business, but feel free to add your opinion. "
p888
aS"Even in my place there is not a local businesses know about bitcoin so i think they didn't have any bad or good thinking ababout bitcoin. In this situation may be a good chance to explain that bitcoin is good currency and has many advantages, said that business will take many benefits by using bitcoin as well. "
p889
aS'It is not easy for a merchant or for a big business to start accepting bitcoin because of the the finance procedures.There should be lots of new employees that should be good "crypto-finance" and do the things that are needed within the company.Larvas has mentioned some good reasons why it is hard for companies to accept bitcoin and collaborate with banks or other things that are needed.'
p890
aS'The best way to make merchants feel motivated to accept the cryptocurrency is to make them realize that there are people using Bitcoin and supporting it. That means, this is something that will depend on the users, the more users using Bitcoin and requesting that the currency be adopted by the merchants, the more this will catch their attention, and they will have more incentive to provide the payment option for Bitcoin.'
p891
aS'I think by the time merchants are doing thousands of dollars a day in transaction in bitcoin then bitcoin will have enough volume to accept those trades without flinching too much, besides if you traded that bitcoin during the course of the day instead of dumping them all at once then your loss if any will be minimal.'
p892
aS"Yes merchants always care for their customers and their say so for example if 80% of their customers demands it then they will consider it and accept it as a payment. But right now that even online shops like amazon or ebay won't accept it we have a much lower chance on local stores to accept bitcoin. When bitcoin hits its peak of popularity local stores will always be the second one to accept it cause not everyone can access the internet."
p893
aS'It will be not that easy, the value of Bitcoin is very volatile, so its not guaranteed that he will be in profit. Moreover its tough in many region to change their mindset. Local small shop owners will not likely take this risk. And yes its much easier and safe to transact, but still its risky and the time taken to complete it sometime is much longer. '
p894
aS'The more people using bitcoin, the stable the prices will be. Therfore, we must do something to encourage them using Bitcoin. If there are billion of people use it, I doubt that no one can easily affect the bitcoin prices and more people will use it as a currency'
p895
aS'Goverment support also affect bitcoin popularity on each country. When more people use bitcoin, bitcoin value will stable just like other currencyFor some country , bitcoin become something criminal so they forbid bitcoin usage'
p896
aS'Local businesses should actually find it easy to adopt bitcoin on the security side of things as holding fiat in their safes or tills attracts robbers unlike a bitcoin wallet which would be safer for them and might encourage their customers to use btc\xc2\xa0 for secure\xc2\xa0 cashless transactions.'
p897
aS"Why do you think that bitcoin is safe for business? Every goverment has their revenue service and in my country it requires bank account. Every detail of transaction is recorded in bank and money is protected under bank, also if there will be wrong transaction, we can to solve problem with bank and in bitcoin's situation, you need cold storage, high protect of private keys and if there will be wrong transaction, you can't get it back. Also price of bitcoin is changing very quickly and that's main reason why local businesses aren't accepting bitcoin."
p898
aS"Correct. They don't need to have the account logged in on their computer at all since they can just look the address on Blockchain to see if the payment of the customer has already received. Right now, robbers aren't interested in bitcoin wallets yet since they don't understand it yet just like most people. But when it come to the time were they are using bitcoins too, the only bitcoin wallet that can be robbed in a store would be those that are logged in on the phones of the people inside that particular store."
p899
aS"How come that there are hacked wallets? I think fiat is still safer when it comes to security of your money. Robbers won't rob you if they see you on busy streets. They attack when you are alone and helpless. If you are holding a bitcoin and you walk on the street and the robber has an idea about bitcoin, then if they rob you, they'll definitely get your bitcoin. Anyway, to encourage them, don't push them to dislike bitcoin. What I mean is explain it few times only and don't be an annoyance. That's all. "
p900
aS"I'd like to think that robbers have different kinds. There are some that attacks you when they're in stealth mode but there are some that takes advantage of the crowd. If you're in a busy street or a crowded place, when he robs you, you'll easily lose track of him since there's a lot of people. Most people on the street won't help you chase the robber since they have other things to be busy about and mostly the robber have other friends to whom he passes the thing that he snatched from you so they can easily get out of the robbery scene."
p901
aS' informing your international clients that the best way to receive payment fast and earlier is through bitcoin. The fees charge by money gram and western union money transfer is too high. Another way I think we can promote bitcoin is by informing \xc2\xa0family and friends about it. Informing family and friends will create trust and first hand explanation about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.'
p902
aS'The fact in real life turns out totally opposite of your motif. Many of the local merchants are not technically aware of the ways bitcoin can be stolen and hence fail to secure them - as a result they end up with robbed coins and they spread the news that bitcoin is a "scam"Then they get hold of the person who introduced the bitcoin payment system to them and put them to jail - because none of the legal people even know about bitcoin or crypto-currency.The fact is we need to make people aware of bitcoin first - but the explaining and trust gaining part is extremely difficult.'
p903
aS'People should consider bitcoin as one of the payment method for buying any thing in local areas, before that we have to explain in detail about bitcoin advantages to them. So local people should can do two types of business with bitcoin and as well as with their store business.'
p904
aS'I think first of all it applies to those shop, markets and stores owners, than the common people will consider bitcoin as one of the payment method.shop owners must allow bitcoin as a accepted method. just like how lots of shops accept credit cards. same they need to accept bitcoin.'
p905
aS'i think your idea can work properly if there are any community or group that giving tutorial or lesson for people so they can trying to search the shop or build their own shop in their city and start to accept bitcoin as their payment. we still having difficulties to find local store that accept bitcoin because the bitcoin education is not much in one city. we should trying to introduce bitcoin into more people and if we have money, then we can build local store and see if there is any progress or not.'
p906
aS'I think most of the people are not completely belief in bitcoin, even though we provide good articles to them they are uncomfortable using it. Because bitcoin price is completely depend on market so many people will not show any interest towards trading side. Bitcoin is mainly depend upon the market.'
p907
aS"Yes the security can be a good thing to encourage those local business owners to adopt bitcoin. And it's the fact with bitcoin has a very good security and its network is going to be tight against intruders. But still it's going to be hard for them if they don't have customers who are using bitcoin, that's why we need also to empower those people who are nearby to his business."
p908
aS'Two things are important in a proper business payment system - the buyer and the seller and in this aspect it is the users of bitcoin. There must be sufficient sellers/merchants accepting bitcoin and even more buyers/customers who are using bitcoin as a currency.This condition is far from the actual in the global economy in the current phase. It is expected that it will improve in the next few decades.Once that happens, the store owners are bound to accept bitcoin as payments due to public demand.'
p909
aS"Business companies should accept BTC because it has an easy transaction characteristic . It is hassle free for them  I think that's the best reason for them to accept Bitcoin . Aside for that the value of bitcoin depend to our support so we should support bitcoin to increase it's value ."

aS"Hassle free? Proper banks, which businesses in most cases use, have several things like:- generate automated monthly payments to your employees - generate automated monthly payments to your bills (gas, electricity, internet etc) - SEPA transfers - different users under one account - templates for your most common transfers - last but not least - everyone supports them, every business, you don't have to even asketc"
p911
aS"And that's why it is going to be hard for us to encourage those business owners if we are not going to inform the people near his business to get into bitcoins. Because business is not going to keep on moving if there are no people that are ready to purchase his products and services with bitcoin. Your discussion to him about bitcoin will be void if his customers are not going to support it."
p912
aS"Oh sure. Keep talking. So what if the network is being spammed just like it is now? Theres over 65000 unconfirmed transactions stuck and we have to wait for more than 8 hours to get 1 confirmation. Is your local business willing to wait that long? Are you? Wait there's a better option. Use cash for your local stores."
p913
aS'Well these cases of a big unconfirmed transactions do happen rarely and its not happening all the times but you are right its quiet hassle for business owners on waiting for that long before the payment would go to their wallets but still its good to consider since bitcoin transactions arent irreversible which means that money will surely be credited on their wallets.'
p914
aS'Aside from that am sure you will not push it since there is no incentives if you do that stuff. \xc2\xa0Remember we need to do some thorough studies, examples, and present it to the business owner. \xc2\xa0Unless we are a supplier, where we can use Bitcoin as means of payment presented with our products. \xc2\xa0This way we have profits. \xc2\xa0But if we do not have anything to profit from that deal i doubt we will push it.'
p915
aS'As bitcoin is a way to conduct transactions through means of the internet and not cash most of the business owners will tin twice before considering to accept payment in btc rather credit or cash.there is no transaction fees as suchTry explaining them about the benefits of bitcoin'
p916
aS'Im sorry to tell you that you are wrong. It has been happening quite a lot than usual. It happened twice this week alone and the length of the mempool being at over 50,000 transactions will almost cover the whole week.The hassle alone is not worth for the shop owners. It would be best for them to stick to what works best. Cash.'
p917
aS"nowadays explaining someone about bitcoin is not a big deal. internet is full of data, contents and details about bitcoin. thousands of websites wrote about bitcoin and it's benefits. so it should be easy for any adult person to get knowledge about bitcoin."
p918
aS'Of course if that adult has proper access to internet and let alone electricity as well. In our country most of the people are below poverty line. They will rob kill or do anything to earn cash and pure cash. They dont trust any cyber coin that floats in midair.Its difficult to explain to them since they dont really care about it. They are poor and if they suspect you of scamming (which they obviously will since for them everything is a scam) - then they will run at you and murder you. So good luck with that '
p919
aS'Yes the knowledge about bitcoin is available everywhere but a person himself cannot learn about its benefits and cannot adopt it without the assistance of any other person. Because he will not know that the adoption of bitcoin will help that person in particularly his own business on which he is now and a person who is already in bitcoin know well that bitcoin is help full in almost every field and he can guide him to follow to that steps. '
p920
aS'Try talking about BTC to your friends or your local shops. You will see the same eye rolling and gaping with their mouth open. Those people will think that youre crazy. We know all the information is available online theres no shortage of it. Everyday something new is available. What we do have a shortage on is a supply of smart people who will try to listen and understand.'
p921
aS'I have had this similar experience myself and ended up making myself a laughing stock among my friends. They think that its a hoax and that bitcoin is made to steal people money when they buy bitcoins. They think its related to hackers and other creepy people who are trying to hack into their bank accounts.Gaining trust in people is a very tough job. For them bitcoin will remain a scam type of money.'
p922
aS"For this, at first you need to have active bitcoin users in real life because if people don't know it, you can't encourage local business to accept btc. At first here is a need of bitcoin's popularity, well it's not easy job but internet makes great actions for that, many people gets information from blogs, news websites and etc. At last, I want to say, if they won't accept bitcoin, they smally affect their business. <-- that's main reason why they have to accept."
p923
aS'Hackers every where, they are currently hacking into thousands of bank accounts and pay them millions of dollars instead of taking their money.There is absolutely no link whatsoever between a bitcoin transaction and bank accounts other than when you sell btc to someone they could send to your bank or pay you in cash. how is that for preventing theft? those are just lame excuses of lazy people not wanting to use their brains.Only thing that could lead to merchants and local businesses to adopt bitcoin payment is for us to demand and demand as well providing them with detailed information on how to setup every thing perfectly to receive the coins and then either hold for profit in future or sell immediately after receiving, but the problem comes to the light when they try to use payment processors and their high fees takes away the incentive.'
p924
aS"but I think if first local businesses start accepting bitcoin than the real life users will use bitcoin. because if there will not be any use of bitcoin why they get btc.. when people see a Bitcoin Accepted Tage in a door of a shop. they'll know bitcoin is accepted there and they'll come there to spend their bitcoins.."
p925
aS'its really hard convincing local businesses to use this system because most of them is not familiar with this type of currency convincing them needs to be more tricky like showing them whats the benefits of fluctuations and how much earnings that they got if they start bitcoin service for sure because its new and there non competition they will be visited with bitcoin holders from that such place.'
p926
aS'Despite the large volume of information, there are people who take a long time to get to know the cryptocurrency. I think this is due to the fact that there are few mainstream communication channels that cover this technology, unfortunately most of these sites only transmit the information to people when Bitcoin is climbing a lot in value.'
p927
aS'It depends on where you are and if the local business works online or just offline. I have a few places around me and I want them to accept BTC but they do not even use internet. It is a really tough sell for them. On the other hand, if its a online store and you know the owner then tell them how bitcoin is growing and how it is the future of currency. Would be helpful for him as well especially if he gets some orders internationally. '
p928
aS'It will be very easy for us to explain to people who wants to setup online shop selling their product for bitcoin. We have explain the benefits that he is going to get with bitcoin and at the same time we have to help him to learn about bitcoin trading. Bitcoin acceptance is a good idea but the price is varying so he may face some looses when price decreases, so we have to train him about trading in this way he may convince about it.'
p929
aS"Explaining is very easy, but convincing them to use bitcoin is the hard part. I am sure that there will always be a hesitation from merchants side as this is new to them and most probably telling them about trading would just make them think that it is risky. I think it should be told when they are already using bitcoin. They should know first that the price of bitcoin fluctuates a lot, so they won't regret it later on that they accept bitcoin."
p930
aS'This is something that, in fact, will depend more on users. Some merchants may not even be interested in decentralization, but certainly they care about profit, so if they realize that there is a high number of active Bitcoin users, they would certainly have an incentive to adopt the currency. If the merchant did not take such measure, the merchant would be at risk of losing customers to a competitor who would use Bitcoin.'
p931
aS'i think by Next 5 year 99.9% companies will accept Bitcoin\xc2\xa0 '
p932
aS'Yes we can encourage local businesses to accept bitcoin by means of letting those business owners to register at online wallet of bitcoin and fiat currency exchange. He/she will appreciate the advantages and usefullness of digital and fiat currency in terms of fast service and low transaction fees. In that aspect of bitcoin overview that online wallet that he/she will be using is a mediator of any currency that will be paid or converted as form of payment which can cash out as profit to them, through recommended bank.'
p933
aS'Yeah flyers and handling them o personally will help you alot in encouraging local businesses to accept bitcoins payments'
p934
aS"Yes there is alot of information about bitcoin in the internet, but problem is that there is too much of information, and when people try to find information about them they simply get lost, they can find what is bitcoin pretty easily but nothing more. And this will happen till someone will create ads/shows about bitcoins and show them to people using tv, that's how we can encourage people and businesses to use bitcoins"
p935
aS'Everything is fine, I have a doubt about how in bitcoin we can manage the taxes and payments which involves the legalized platform in decentralized currency. Then all kind of payments would against legal rules right. I think first we need bitcoin to accept by government then only your view possible in real life.'
p936
aS'This is a mammoth task convincing local businesses but the best easy targets should be those that provide digital content that might be easy targets for charge backs and fraud, and introducing them to bitcoins should cut down on those scams to zero which should be a huge benefit to use btc!'
p937
aS'Ok then who will be their customers thats using BTC? Its already hard to start a Bitcoin accepting online shop because most BTC hodlers would select to keep their coins or sell it for cash because its more convenient for them than buying stuff directly with BTC. Theres no need for your local shops to accept BTC. Do this. Name what local shops in your area should accept BTC and discover why havent they accepted it. '
p938
aS"I agree with you, Bitcoin's cureency is legal. Taxes abd payments can be added by a country's government if they want through giving taxes for every single transaction, cashing in, and cashing out. Some government support Bitcoin already to be used in legal business purposes and payments for online transaction. It's indication that Bitcoin has a future in the market."
p939
aS"I doubt that there would be a reasonable reason why should they accept bitcoins. Local shops would always have local customers that have local fiat. Only reason for a local shop to accept bitcoins is if there's a lot of tourists coming to his shop. Example of this is in Hawaii, tourists all over the world are there and using bitcoins would save customers the hassle to convert their money to your local currency. Same advantage to you, you wouldn't have to convert their money to your local currency before you can use it.In other words, bitcoin is the only true universal currency and a local shop would only be needing to accept bitcoins if they have customers from all over the world."
p940
aS'Thats what I keep saying. Yet I see many other people dont care and keep saying that local shops should accept BTC. Its really hard to be involved in a good discussion because they dont read the posts.Everyone, theres no need for your local shop to accept BTC. All they need is cash. Cash simply works and its faster.'
p941
aS'Explain to them about bitcoin price and encourage them to invest in it as bitcoin price is high and will continue to rise in future.'
p942
aS"Bitcoin is not for streets and local stores, I think it's better if everyone just sticks to use it as an online currency and payment method.Most of the world haven't heard about bitcoin yet. only online communities need to adopt the system, expecting the streets to adopt it is too optimistic.Do you truly believe that yourself or just saying it? if you do then you should be buying every day to accumulate for the future."
p943
aS"One of my friend on another forum told me to invest in btc to make easy profit at that time btc price was around $630-650 I've got some good profit over past few months so if people can encourage local business to invest in btc then they will for sure. "
p944
aS'The idea of encouraging them to accept bitcoins is just another option for them and they can even do something new about it. We know that most of them are just accepting cash but this type of acceptance for their payments is somehow unique though the thing is that you just need to explain to them what bitcoin is and possibility to create another investment with it.'
p945
aS'Regular online stores dont have to use BTC either. Thanks to the banks and credit cards, buying what you want online hasnt been so much easier. Imagine youre a regular user who doesnt own any BTC. All you have to do is search on Google and you find everything you want all payable by using your credit card. Why do I need to go to an online Bitcoin shop and do all the hassle of buying a small amount of BTC just to buy an item thats already available at a regular online shop?'
p946
aS"It can be an option for them but what use will it be for them? Will it be worth it for them to hold BTC with all the volatility, the recently regular high mem pool size and the hassle to convert back to fiat? Are the local shops' customers BTC holders? If only adding another option is your reason, why not encourage them to accept US dollars or gold as well? Those are good options too. "
p947
aS"It's not that an easy thing that you are going to say and encourage them easily with bitcoin that way. You must encourage them with a proof and basis so that you can encourage them properly. Encouraging them by simply explaining to them about bitcoins price and other things about bitcoin is insufficient for them."
p948
aS"It has to have convenience involve before they will start accepting. If Uber Taxi App starts accepting BTC, then I guess its going to be easy to spread the word about bitcoin through these drivers. they travel all the time and with BTC logo on the taxi\xc2\xa0 cab, I think is going to be a good way for the adoption problems we have right now. If bitcoin will be accepted, all altcoins will soon be recognized as well from major crypto like ETH, XMR, DASH and so on including the Nxt. We don't have to wait for more than 10 years to see how this could go."
p949
aS'Youre going way overboard in including all those altcoins in the mix. You even mentioned NXT in their which I find so hilarious. Those altcoins are all ponzis and theyre all good for speculation and nothing else. How do you expect the Uber driver to feed himself with NXT? Im laughing right now as I type this. Campaigning for BTC acceptance is already hard enough.'
p950
aS"I like the idea of uber taxi app and other the same app such as GrabTaxi they should be encourage to use bitcoin. Since they have different types of payment, cash,uberpay/grabpay,credit card then there should be some other ways like bitcoin and it's really interesting if they will allow it to happen. The word will spread very fast with their users."
p951
aS"I think pointing them to the price of BTC and that it will rise doesn't seem trustworthy.. You should rather try to explain how the whole System works and mention why it is better than Fiat money.Give them advantages.. then you mention side effect of rising price. "
p952
aS"They might don't need it but if there are certain people or business owners that are very interested with the acceptance and usage of bitcoin. They will gladly accept you and there are people that are not that good with technology but wants to gain their knowledge with it and there are some that really don't care at all."
p953
aS'Yes indeed the advantage in local businesses are getting a lot of member and will certainly get great returns, let alone our business wake up using bitccoin. Although it has many advantages but it still has a lot of harm if we do not want to secure transaction or our business properly. Because broadly speaking bitcoin is a place that is very prone to be theft.No problems did make the local business base bitcoin, but we should be able to do very well in order to benefit measurable as we want'
p954
aS'the only disadvantaged I think is that we can let the customers made their identity real, some might not use their real names and might use other names. We should still be careful implementing btc but it is RY a good way to\xc2\xa0 do business.'
p955
aS'To encourage local businesses to accept bitcoin as their another kind of payment system, we should explain how the bitcoin works and what are the good benefit of accepting and owning a bitcoin in a very short and simple way because if we explain it on a long and complicated way then they will lose their interest.'
p956
aS'Much more we should spent on showing, how the system works and what principles and advangtages they get against other payment methods like fiat money, banking system and how easy they can manipulate there own money without any other counsel '
p957
aS"As of now bitcoin is expanding and upgrading each day. There's a big future out of bitcoin. Soon local buisness would know information about bitcoin as it becoming popular . So it's not hard for them to convinced to consider bitcoin to their business. Fast transaction , reliable wallet and the rapid increase value of bitcoin is just some of the traits that can convince people to use it as well the local bussines."
p958
aS'Most of the people and the owners are not knowing about bitcoin in many developing and developed countries. This community is a small fraction of the entire population of the earth. However it is upto some non-profit organisation to devlelop systems to encourage the users to accept bitcoin and for owners to accept it too.Then again there is another problem - 1st impression of bitcoin is that is a hackers money, scam coin, coin for drugs etc. People consider bitcoin=scam, ponzi. Since this misconception is the first impression it is difficult to work around it and make them trust it.Because after all if you make them trust it, you have to maintain that trust. One single wrong step and they will blame you for everything, even if it was their fault.'
p959
aS'Also tell them that if they are going to accept bitcoin they can be considered as unique business because this is not popular. If they will accept they are one of the very few in the metro that is accepting it.'
p960
aS'I agree on this part. It may lead them to become a pioneer in the bitcoin payment system. This can help them more popularity and thus make the people accept the payment mode.I have made this opinion to many of the merchants in my country\xc2\xa0 already. I hope at least one of them will be accepting it in future and then others will follow the lead.'
p961
aS'We encourage them by step by step proceduresFirst we need an information dessimination or let them know the advantages of btc by giving seminars.Next is give them support from other big companies because they need them to continues their business, how they can appreciate the btc if the other big companies are not recognize or accepting btc from them to support thwir business, right? So this is a domino effect if tje big companies allowing them to do buaoness transactions using btc then thats the time that local businesses will acknowledge the btc idea.'
p962
aS"I hope that merchants on your country will be encouraged that way. We know that being a pioneer is a big thing especially when it comes to business ideas. And they don't even have to pay pioneer fees or any memberships fees just for receiving and adopting bitcoin to their business. It's really unique to have this type of payment, just tell them."
p963
aS'In my country 10% of taxi drivers accept payment in bitcoins. To persuade anyone not necessary. Due to the fact that the crisis in the country and they have little orders they are willing to work for any money. I think we have a lot of offers payment in bitcoin, its prevalence will continue to grow.'
p964
aS'bitcoin develop the local sector certainly requires a high effort. now, several startups have emerged. but they have not fully using bitcoin. maybe when juxtaposed the use bitcoin is still only about 10% of all transactions. we must continue to encourage the development of bitcoin-by were able to reach their future goals bitcoin in the future.'
p965
aS'It is good progress, but the problem is whether users of taxis have debit cards, course without a bitcoin debit card will be difficult to direct transaction and maybe they will use real money.'
p966
aS"HelloI have a small site with paid monthly services.I wish to work with bitcoin,but I have the following question:price per month is \xc2\x80 400 (Euro pay my food)to put a price must be on what course to equal?and if they told me,pay with bitcoin I then have to change to euro1. it can drop the value of bitcoin2 will lose the difference in changeif I'm wrong please tell me how to,do the payment with bitcoinRegards"
p967
aS'What country are you from and what wallet solutions do they use? I also want to know how many people pay them in BTC on a daily basis because there arent that many BTC users around the world. Plus Bitcoiners do not tend to spend their BTC because its a better as an investment.'
p968
aS'Show them all the advantages that they can get om, and also try to make some studies on how they can manipulate the coin, on how the bitcoin generated to the market and so for sure if they got the bitcoin in good terms they will be into it.'
p969
aS"Yes we need to highlight all the benefits of bitcoin to them that's the best way to encourage local business to use bitcoin and also if possible you can start your own business and start using bitcoin as a payment method so that other local business will automatically do a research about bitcoin and i am sure once someone is aware of benefits of bitcoin over the fiat currency surely they will go for bitcoin."
p970
aS'To a layman explaining what is bitcoin,Will be a very lengthy process and it also may not yield the desired results.So I insist you to encourage them to make a small investment,On bitcoins ( only the amount whose loss they can bear).They would definitely like using bitcoins in future as a trade mediator in the future I assume.( If they use it once)'
p971
aS'You owe it to yourself to find a bitcoin/crypto Meetup in a nearby city, where you might likely run into people similar to yourself who are aware of what works best in your jurisdiction.'
p972
aS'Exactly, a further explanation will do for them to be enlighten that bitcoin is a good system to use as payment and more secure. Laid them all the advantages that they can get when they use this as way of paying them.'
p973
aS"To encourage local businesses accept bitcoin of course we must introduce bitcoin and bitcoin payment system with them. But it would be difficult if the person does not support or dubious bitcoin as a payment that is profitable. With improved security, ease of transaction, and the development of bitcoin at this time I'm sure they would be interested if knew it and make local businesses start using bitcoin."
p974
aS"Yeah that's the way that it is indeed very good thing to do. Because with it, those who have not understood the bitcoin will easily understand it and if they have a high interest in I am sure they will use the bitcoin. For if they do not have the desire to use it then it will not be useful any information we provide. So the main thing to be used as a benchmark are those which we shall give the information has a good interest for using bitcoin\xc2\xa0"
p975
aS'Im very sure they will all be disappointed despite all the advantages you can conjure and market to them. The volatility alone is a big turn off. There is also the issue of the hard fork coming that might split the blockchain in 2. Is that a currency that will give them an advantage?'
p976
aS"Yes, but most of the shop, keepers will not bother about their customer's identity because some people are accepting bitcoin only to annoy paying taxes to the governments. Really, it is a good idea if the shopkeeper can keep track of their customer's identity for safety reasons."
p977
aS"If they are legit surely they will not bother anything that can make their costumer harm but in this case im also sure that they can get free advertisement on bitcoins.Imagine how many bitcoin users around the globe, If they would know shop who almost got all the goods that people they needs well surely the site who accepts bitcoins will get a mass success and the bunos their as you said they will defy the taxes who's been implemented on some online shops."
p978
aS"In its current state bitcoin is not exactly the best method to implement as your payment. It is still great store of value though.But that is not really a concern for any of these merchants, as they don't store bitcoins anyway when BitPay is used as BTC payment processor.Hard Fork split wont happen bitcoin community and developers won't ever allow that. It would undermine bitcoin's position greatly, miners are aware of that."
p979
aS'Merchants needs to realize that bitcoin wallet is a good way for easy transferring of money and it will helps them alot to ensures the payment. It will also help knowing that bitcoin value is rapidly increasing. They can save enough and can use transactions monitoring.'
p980
aS' Everything starts with small idea like this, we must explain what is bitcoin is all about, we have to explain the benefits like its security feature, about cryptography, about less transaction charges, more value even just storing it. so more people will adopt into the btc world and we will see high growth soon. '
p981
aS"Its not hard to convince people to star using bitcoins but it will depend on how you are good at convincing other and if you tell them that they can earn more money with bitcoins then you don't have to explain them anything else and they will start to know more about bitcoins."
p982
aS"Well, i couldn't agree more with you above. It will be great.But when we see from local businesses eye, all of your suggestion will considered if the around society also use bitcoin and don't mind to use it on real payment in real life.For me as bitcoin's user i like if i can use bitcoin to pay or buy something without changing it to my fiat first. It make me more easy using bitcoin."
p983
aS"[1] - On the contrary, there's not much people in the society using bitcoins. There are theories that as humans, we tend to copy other people. If everyone else is using bitcoins, eventually you'll use bitcoins as well. But we're not at that point yet. We're still at the starting point where the growth is the slowest (with exception on other things of course).The case today: People are going to use bitcoins when they read about it online and got interested about it. Not because the society is using it already.[2] That's every bitcoin user's dream. To use his bitcoins for payment without requiring to convert it to fiat first. Sadly, there's not that much shop that allows that."
p984
aS'If the stores were to use a payment processor anyway then its better for them to accept credit cards and prepaid debit cards. The amount of BTC purchases will not justify the acceptance because paying with fiat will make more sense. The hard fork will not happen? It is gaining more mining power and has hit 40% the last few days. Once it reaches 50% theres no going back. It will gain more momentum. There is nothing the developers and community can do except try to hold on that will cause to split the blockchain. For a Legendary I am surprised with your misinformed post.'
p985
aS'Thats the problem, Only a few number of people are using bitcoin today furthermore convincing other people is not that easy. Lets not rush things, What we should do now is to spread awareness and to help bitcoin have a good impression on others. That being said my suggestion is to accept different popular payment methods along bitcoin. To be honest accepting bitcoin only is not that good for your business.'
p986
aS"Yes, but they need to wait when the price of bitcoin decreases. The price of bitcoin decreases they won't get the actual value of the product, so in this case, shop keeper's will be in loss, so it will be very hard to convince the local business people."
p987
aS'\xc2\xa0I think you can give them a short explantion as to why you support bitcoin.'
p988
aS"Short explanation isn't going to be enough to show those local business owners why you support bitcoin and on how they are going to benefit from it.You need to show and explain why they are going to get benefit from it like giving their customers another way of paying their services and goods.And of course disclose to them the disadvantage of it."
p989
aS'And when you speak or disclose about its disadvantage then most of them or all of those owners will directly neglect or refuse bitcoin but well its a part on explaining it so that they would be aware about bitcoin even more.Local business owners cant really easy adopt bitcoin since its not being regulated by the government and they dont like unstable prices.'
p990
aS'We must demand that they accept bitcoin and we must persist that accepting bitcoin as payment can bring in more sales and new customers. We must keep persisting that they accept bitcoin. With enough people, they might consider it as one of their payment methods. Hopefully as bitcoin users increase, it will influence businesses.'
p991
aS'well demand will let them think to accept it and more explanation and showing the advantage and benefits of using bitcoin for their businesswill also gather their interest, as business minded people always look for an advantage for their profits so if they will see that bitcoin will givethem favor for sure they will embrace it in no time.'
p992
aS"I guess they won't since they are open-minded and they know how business works, for sure they know that it has risk and negative impact to the people.They will simply understand it as long as you can defend that negativity into positive opportunity."
p993
aS'I think if people are already using bitcoins, merchants will just follow. Imagine if you\'re the owner and someone asked you if you\'re accepting bitcoins, and then after a short while somebody asked you again. And then the next day somebody asked you again, you surely will be totally curious about what\'s bitcoin. If you push a business owner to accept bitcoins because it will "bring more sales and new customers" and there\'s not that much bitcoin users at the area, he will just be disappointed at you because you forced him and all his efforts are for nothing.'
p994
aS'We can encourage local businesses to accept Bitcoin by embarking on massive enlightenment campaign via mass media, with the aid of banners ,posters e.t.c\xc2\xa0 local business will thrive if more people accept Bitcoin as means of payment.'
p995
aS'It depends on the approach you will made on how you would able to explain but there are business owners who were close minded persons which they would stand for their own views and beliefs in terms of business and most of them do really like to play safe which means chances of being rejected or neglected about bitcoin would be really high.'
p996
aS'yeah you should have a good and a little bit large bitcoin community around ,so you can make the job to encourage local business to accept bitcoin easier ,explain everything together and it will attract people to come ,as they curious what happening there , and that time is the show time.'
p997
aS"It wil be great if local businesses accepts bitcoin but why not focus on the root of the problem on why they don't accept it? Imo it is because they have never heard of it/using it and not a single customer have mentioned it. I'm one of those people who believes that if bitcoin became popular, Its acceptance from various kinds of business will naturally come. What we should do now is to increase the satisfied bitcoin users."
p998
aS"Yes as long as you are going to approach them positively and on a encouraging spirit that can make them brought up with your feeling.And when they feel that you are sincere and they are going to trust you, they won't have any doubts on you.But make sure that you are not going to force them to accept bitcoin, it will be the bad way of encouraging them."
p999
aS'It takes more than positivity to encourage people to basically change their perception of money and move into cryptocurrency. Change is scary for most people. We have to really convince them about the benefits and uses of bitcoin.'
p1000
aS"Now with the Hard Fork possibility it will be really hard to encourage someone to start accepting Bitcoins... The possibility of a splitted community doesn't inspire confidence from investors and businessmen looking for a new payment method for their sites, stores, etc. The best to do is to observe what will happen with the currency in the next days and weeks. Introduce a layman in Crypto-Currency now can be frustrating."
p1001
aS'Actually they don\'t have to move from money to crypto currency. It\'s all about acceptance and there\'s no risk on it if we are going to see it on the lighter side.They will just simply apply this "Bitcoin accepted here." Simple as that and they don\'t even have to invest on it but only by accepting payment with bitcoin.Another thing is the price is very unstable that can give them some fear.'

aS"Still, many people don't know about this hard fork yet because only a few people who are showing interest towards bitcoin will understand the word hard fork. I hope it is not possible with bitcoin and also it is not the right time to suggest for local business people if bitcoin price falls down they will scare about it."
p1003
aS"I think the problem is that it is too volatile at the moment for shops to accept Bitcoin. If they pay their suppliers in Fiat, then by the time they have sold the goods Bitcoin could experience a drop in price so even if the store owner sold the goods, they still might not be better off.It will happen I'm sure, just not until it stabalises more on price."
p1004
aS"that's why i told you to ask for friends help to explain bitcoin together lol ,then you can figure out what makes people don't want to start using bitcoin ,why they did not know yet about this cool and popular stuff on the internet ,find a solution for that and convince them bitcoin has a lot of advantage to offers."
p1005
aS'They need to understand bitcoin price will be up and down, but in this matter, the local shopkeeper will not convince about the price speculation.They set up a business for money, but if they lost through trading than to regain the money it is not possible. Because bitcoin is completely online stuff.'
p1006
aS'The current state of the volatility in Bitcoin would be a big disappointment for local businesses right now. Will that mean they will keep adjusting their prices? What about the present BTC they are holding, that means they are losing value by holding them. Bitcoin was worth 1200 3 weeks ago now it is worth below 1000.'

aS'Dear knightkon,You are very welcome to get involved with the revolutionary Blockpay product recently developed by Bitshares Munich. Please see the video below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcuVSjR6gkkSee also their link attached here:https://blockpay.ch/As you can see, retailers are now able to accept any digital currency or asset (not only Bitcoin) as payment for their goods or services in a matter of seconds. Moreover, the volatility issue has been resolved with this new technology including smartcoins pioneered by Bitshares. The Blockpay solution works at any brick and mortar (physical) or online store. The retailers just need to download and use the Blockpay app as a point of sale. They are also able to cash out the earned money in their local FIAT currency bank accounts if they wish to. If you download the smartcoins app and blockpay app yourself, get the product information as well in printed version, then show your local retailers a live Blockpay demo, they might take you very seriously indeed. Regards'

aS'Offcourse we can encourage local business owners to accept bitcoin by introducing bitcoin to them and making them understand the advantages of it. But it all depends upon the country. Because shop owners are answerable to government officials during the financial year end for the tax related issues. Its easy to accept bitcoin as payment in countries were bitcoin is officially annouced as legal . '
p1009
aS"One country that legally accepts bitcoin is Japan. As you can see, there's no need to market bitcoin there as Japanese people are accepting it enthusiastically.https://news.bitcoin.com/japan-bic-camera-starts-accepting-bitcoin/So you are correct, it really depends on the country if they legalized or against bitcoin. For countries that's against it, local owners or merchants will be facing a huge barrier promoting or accepting bitcoin as payment specially if you have a offline business. On the contrary, if you have a on-line business, you just have to put an option you are accepting bitcoin as mode of payment. Let bitcoin promote itself in your website. Maybe other will be curious as to what bitcoin is, and will probably use it as mode of payment when they understand how bitcoin works and what advantage they can have if they use it as payment scheme."
p1010
aS'how to approach the local business and introduce this bitcoin bitcoin like where do they work, after it beriakan real evidence for them so that they know what is bitcoin.certainly not regret familiar with the evolving bitcoin bitcoin?'
p1011
aS'We can encourage local business by showing them the features and benefits of bitcoins but before that we need to make sure that even the people around us are aware about bitcoins and are using it and are willing to spend them for shopping purposes then only it will attract merchants to start accepting bitcoins.'
p1012
aS"It's very easy, just give them some examples of those successful bitcoin business owners."
p1013
aS"Most of the successful business owners were holding big capital investment as well most of them were large scale traders and gambling site managers. Another important platform available is to create blockchain based applications which is gonna make big change in the mobile usage. Other than these it's good to accept bitcoin same as physical currency acceptance."
p1014
aS'Lots of new digitally mode of payments or for any services and transactions now relating to money were accepted by many now,its benefiting the customer as well the businessman. For the customer for easy and less hassle transactions,same with businessman for attracting more customers knowing their capable of accepting online payments. Same with bitcoin knowing there were numbered of users now, they might got interest on it too plus the features and services bitcoin can offers to them too.'
p1015
aS"It's not that easy even you will show them the greatness of bitcoin. But once they saw that bitcoin is stable enough and that is going to be a plus for their business if they had the option of being paid with bitcoin for what they are selling. That can give their customers a lot of choice for purchasing everything they've got."
p1016
aS'Its easy only bro. If he wish to implement the bitcoin as payment mode in the local business. First, bitcoin should be legal in that country until its not not easy accept bitcoin for purchases, still if you look into use bitcoin means use it for your international trades and businesses need to transact to the other country people via bitcoin. It will reduce forex and other charges for international transactions.'
p1017
aS'For the mainstream it would be better to let them their Euros and Dollars and just use BTC as actually money.So if someone easy can pay in a bar with his smartphone and everywere it is accepted - they will do it.But if u try to explain an uninteressted newbie about BTC and how it works - they shut down and say - i stay by my knowing money.'
p1018
aS"I think there's no need of legality as it is not recognized by the government and besides it is a business entity, he may wish to receive bitcoin,checks,cash or even debts. But the fact that we can't convince that easily those business owners as long as they aren't going to see a very good progress, the location may affect them if there are no bitcoin users near them, what's the use?"
p1019
aS'I will explain to them thoroughly and encourage to them that a bitcoin is many benefits and the purposes like expenses. And this is the good investment. I introduce to them that this is an international currency of an investors. All they need to do is give more spend time and understand well.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Easy to invest here and how can they earn more. .'
p1020
aS'Exactly bitcoin has a lot of benefit for them and if they will explore bitcoin forum they will get to know bitcoin benefits in real life. It is not hard to encourage them if they are really a big and huge level businessman as now bitcoin is common all people are aware of bitcoin, bitcoin can be sue as side source of income for them if they will invest the spare money in bitcoin and then hold it for long time along with bitcoin a person can start some other business as well and it will support him in time of sudden crises.'
p1021
aS'I think that is not possible right now as the price of bitcoin goes down business owners wil find it too risky and the price is flactuates too much.I think it is only possible if the owner is a trader himself.He could use that btc to make some moves on the market.'
p1022
aS'before we introduce bitcon into people, i think we should give them an explaining about bitcoin and we can give them an example of how to using bitcoin and make any transaction with easy. it should need hard work and there is no one can do without other people. so maybe you can make little group with your friends which using bitcoin and start to make a community and make meeting discussion group and ask people to join, then in that meeting group you can tell them about bitcoin. its really need hard work to do this but after you success, then people in your city will appreciate to you and make bitcoin as payment soon'
p1023
aS'Right...he can be a trader. You can encourage the local business owner to take advantage on the flactuation of the bitcoin and other crypo currencies. He can trade the crypto currencies since the value today is still low.'
p1024
aS"Yes you are right but we need to teach them to get into bitcoin because the world is moving so fast but many of us still don't about technologies and it's use so we need make awareness about bitcoin in all possible ways this is only way to encourage local businesses to get into bitcoin. "
p1025
aS"Encouraging People are very difficult task for us but if we can explain properly what bitcoin really is, and what it uses and its beauty and purpose, I'm sure, we can attract them to join and invest in bitcoin. Also, all people only wants to earn money, want their business to grow and have more income.\xc2\xa0 "
p1026
aS'Perhaps, a good idea would be to give bitcoins to the development of a real business with the condition that the future company will be accept bitcoins as a payment for its services'
p1027
aS"Kind of touched on already but convincing businesses of the benefits of BTC right now what with the current value and uncertainty wouldn't be wise!"
p1028
aS'bitcoin in my country is doing great and it has a lot of benefits for example paying bills online remittances . banking / buying prepaid loads and recently they some restaurant are already listed and they are accepting bitcoin as a payment so much innovation is happening in bitcoin.'
p1029
aS'It is very hard here in india to promote bitcoin as a payment system... as there is still not very much awareness and even govt policy is also not very clear... Hope in future things will be easy, then only we can think of it.'
p1030
aS'Making them see the change and how your trading life has bloomed over the years of use because local users will find it difficult to believe without testimonies. '
p1031
aS' just outline the obvious for them, let them know that this is a possible route to grow larger incomes. For one example Credit card fees usually run around 2-3%, which can make a considerable dent in the profits of businesses operating on low margins, but with bitcoin, you can pay substantially lower fees (~ 1%) without needing a huge volume of transactions as leverage with the credit card company. And that\xc2\x92s only if you transfer your money back into local currency \xc2\x97 if you keep in bitcoin, you can essentially avoid fees altogether and even invest at this current time to see a spike in turn\xc2\xa0 over.'
p1032
aS'I recognized this is the most important in the crypto world. My own store now accept BTC as a contribution to this revolution . '
p1033
aS'If you or we run a business then it is the best way to start from ourselves.If not then we should tell and show them how other big businesses are accepting bitcoins.Telling them the bitcoin opportunities and how they can earn more if the price increases after the sales.'
p1034
aS'maybe this one can help.Merchant bitcoin point-of-sale (POS) solutions.There is also a growing number of commerce-specific options that aim to streamline the process of taking bitcoin payments. The following services offer a variety of POS solutions for merchants, both online and off.CoinifyCoinify, a Danish firm that acquired BIPS and Coinzone, offers POS solutions for both brick-and-mortar and online stores. Merchants can get paid in bitcoin or fiat currency \xc2\x96 or a mixture of the two \xc2\x96 and its mobile app, Coinify POS, works with both Android and iOS devices.'
p1035
aS'The only way to convince local businesses to accept a cryptocurrency is to offer them an incentive. They are highly unlikely to start accepting it just because they think the idea of a cryptocurrency is "cool" after learning about it in a seminar, as someone suggested earlier. This is the problem with BTC that Zeden (http://zeden.io/) tries to address. Zeden\'s referral program offers this incentive: refer someone to start using/accepting it, get 70% of all their transaction fees for the next 2 years. Therefore, someone who refers a local business to start accepting Zeden can benefit, and the local business can benefit by referring its customers. The local business can choose to discount its goods if the customers pay with Zeden, since after all, the local business could potentially receive a steady flow of passive income for the next 2 years from the people it refers. Therefore, local businesses and its customers may finally have an incentive to use it.'
p1036
aS'You should make a group that you can explain to them what bitcoin is, how to use bitcoin and other. If you tell them one by one it will took a longer time. '
p1037
aS"tell them about bitcoin is ease to use.Bitcoin is a great alternative because of the ease of use, ease of storage, security of storage,and it's also the only thing in the world you can send halfway around the world in less time than it takes to snap your fingers, and for free."
p1038
aS"This is what I do:1) Don't buy from them if they don't accept bitcoin. When I have extra time, I'll let their manager know that if they accepted the easiest non-paper payment method on earth to accept... they would not only get me as a customer, but a very loyal customer. When it is companies like a coffee place, i'll tell them why I buy Starbucks coffee instead of their coffee: simply because I can buy a gift card for Starbucks with bitcoin.2) When EVER I tip someone, it's in bitcoin. Don't have a bitcoin wallet on your smart phone, eh? Then sorry... no tip for you. Actually, I've tipped easily over 100 individuals. I've only had 2 people refuse a tip--1 person who's phone died and they wouldn't accept a paper wallet, and another person who rudely tried to educate me on how to write a tip amount onto a merchant receipt. If it were worth my time, I would've showed them how to download apps on their phone "
p1039
aS"You should all know: businesses don't care about accepting another form of money. They're flooded with requests from all sorts of companies. HOWEVER, they just want to know that they're going to get more customers. And the more loyal these customers, the better!"
p1040
aS'It is really not easy since a low percentage of people know Bitcoin, especially explain to merchands.It is easier to explain to people who send/receive money internacionally the benefits of using Bitcoin.Introducing friends to start at Bitcoin world even collecting some sats from faucets is also a good idea.'
p1041
aS'Yess i agree, in this case we need some support to convince our local business to start accepting bitcoin.The most affected support i think is government. Once they declare to support bitcoin , it will make easy task to do this.'
p1042
aS'Just when you see that chart and bitcoin value if going up, you might want to announce discount sale and maybe 20% discount for buyers who will use BTC to buy your items. Once people asks about what BTC is, you show them some inforgraphic of BTC, there are infographics that already exist online. Sooner they might just buy btcs to you '
p1043
aS"tell the about all advantage of bitcoin,the them that you also easy to use bitcoin.tell them bitcoin is a great alternative because of the ease of use, ease of storage, security of storage,and it's also the only thing in the world you can send halfway around the world in less time than it takes to snap your fingers, and for free."
p1044
aS'But unfortunately bitcoin is not that easy to use, besides they will probably want to exchange the bitcoins into cash sooner or later, there are systems for online business but for physical business using bitcoins is a bit more complicated.'
p1045
aS'Nah, I agree over these two guys, your point is so great. yeah, government will takes great impact if they "say" will adopting bitcoin, then we\'ll see bitcoin will be well known for a huge people.. '
p1046
aS'I asked a friend t accept bitcoin. He told me it is too risky. The price is too volatile, he does not know the price for the next day.'
p1047
aS'its very hard to explain bitcoin to a non-computer guy, no matte the age ...'
p1048
aS'Even with the volatility risk, I think that business who accept Bitcoin could have a significant advantage from their competitors as more and more people become aware of Bitcoin everyday.IMO, business who accept Bitcoins can attract a new type of customers and makes them loyal.'
p1049
aS'I mean that\'s great and all to try and promote Bitcoin that way, I mean I\'m still working through an internship program at the moment and work in the food/service industry still and would love to get a tip and talk about Bitcoin with someone like yourself, but fuck... Just because they don\'t feel like learning something when they are probably extremely busy and just want the convenience in receiving a normal tip is to be expected, shouldn\'t be considered "rude". They work hard, and litterally served you.. Why should you deny them tip when they are probably working for way under minimum wage?If I were you I would still offer the Bitcoin tips and promote them to getting a wallet, but if they don\'t want it, just say ok and move on to giving them that dirty fiat. You\'re essentially trying to tell them that fiat is no good and they should accept your digital gold, and it would make more of a statement if you tipped them more in fiat than you would have in Bitcoin. I would also suggest making a little business card or flyer to leave business or people who serve you, so when they do have a chance to sit down and relax after a hard days work, they might get really interested in what you had to say after all, and start reading what you left them. You don\'t have to completely stiff them a tip, now that\'s "rude".'
p1050
aS'I always use this method, when I approach them. I ask them if they accept Bitcoin. If the reply is NO, I ask Why not? ~ If they say, What is Bitcoin - I would explain it shortly and direct them to online Bitcoin processors. ~ If they say, What is the advantage for them? - I would highlight the cost savings and the edge they have over \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0other companies that did not accept it yet. ~ If they say, There is not enough demand for it - I send friends to their business to ask this same question. It works 9 out of 10 times for me. Try that, it just works. ^hmf^'
p1051
aS'Maybe sellers who fund retailers could give a discount for people who pay in bitcoin. This will encourage retailers to use bitcoin, and in turn, maybe ask their customers for bitcoin for their good.'
p1052
aS'I think the easiest way is still a payment processor.- registration is free- they receive the full amount without paying any fees - there is no risk of holding any bitcoins- receiving fiat currencies is easier to handle for them in terms of accounting, taxes etc.basically its just like paypal minus the fees.They dont even have to know anything about bitcoins.Once they accept bitcoin and do actually have a significant number of bitcoin customers they can allways switch to accepting bitcoins directly and selling them on their own.'

S"Hi GuysI've been in the crypto scene for many years now, first time post here over a dilemma I am facing.So, I am fortunate enough to make 600k from buying and trading Bitcoin and other crypto assets, and I don't know what to do with the money. Personally I think this is the year I will become a millionaire, as I can only see the marketcap of all coins growing. But friends close to me think I am an idiot for not selling yet, and if it were to collapse to zero, I would never forgive myself. But they don't know the market like I do, and I do believe that it is only the beginning. They say I should sell 95% buy a house, a car and live a nice lifestyle. I am frugal, have always lived within my means and never spent any crypto money as of yet, but I am tempted to start spending some of it now. I am 26 years old, rent an apartment and drive a car worth less than most peoples pushbikes.My portfolio currently looks like this....43% Raiblocks40% Oyster Pearl5% Enigma4%Dash1.5% Bitcoinand tiny holdings in Waves, Lisk, Stratis, Game.....I think that both XRB and PRL can double easily this year.This is not based on greed btw, I want to make enough money so I can buy my siblings houses and see them mortgage free.What would you do if you were me? When do we call it a day and give up trading?Many thanks for your help in advance."
p1
aS'You are a newby in the forum yet you\xc2\xb4ve made a small fortune in crypto? Ok, let\xc2\xb4s assume that\xc2\xb4s true and thus my advice is sell half and keep playing with the other half.'
p2
aS'Sell, pay your taxes call it quits. '
p3
aS"Are you saying you've never taken profit to USD? You've been actively trading altcoins.... what is your tax situation? How do you plan to deal with the capital gains? Raiblocks has already seen phenomenal growth. Sure, another double is possible, but the idea of not taking some profit off the table seems certifiably insane to me. Your portfolio is not well-diversified. I would stop thinking about buying people houses and start thinking about better diversification and overall exit plan. You especially need to craft a tax plan that considers short term vs. long term gains and maximizes the capital you can reinvest. Remember, none of this is real until you have some of that USD value stashed in real bank accounts. It's prudent to put some gains away for taxes and a few years of living expenses, while reinvesting profits from your remaining capital investments. "
p4
aS'For some reason this sounds like that trevon james character from his portfolio (the oyster coin gave it away cause he was wondering to buy some or not in one of his recent yt videos) and he just posted a video 3 hours ago saying the same thing essentially:I am going to sell all my crypto/bitcoin! '
p5
aS"I think OP can definitely diversify his portfolio more, but he's definitely gotten to the point where if he grabs even just some of his gains and brings it out, he can put it into long term investments like mutual funds/stocks and make even more a bit more safely. OP, I suggest you take some out (not all in case your predictions are true), and make sure you keep enough in so that any profits you make will still be relevant. Regardless, you always want to look to come out positive and remember that with crypto trading (and trading in general), you haven't made any money until you convert it to fiat."
p6
aS'Why not Monero?Forget your friends, keep Hodling!'
p7
aS'Very very strange portfolio\xc2\xa0 '
p8
aS"Damn that's some profit you made there with a very unique portfolio. Every single coin mentioned has a bright future, so you could just hold onto everything and wait till it grows to $1M or just sell half of it and play around with the other half. Either ways, your majority investments being XRB and PRL is just crazy as both have high potential for growing."
p9
aS"With 600k it's a huge amount so you can invest. Your portfolio is quite good with strong peers, so I just wonder why you only invest in bitcoins with a very small amount, since normally you should keep more bitcoins. For you DCA coin drops, that's about your backup. I think you should keep yourself more bitcoin, that's my advice."
p10
aS"\xc2\xa0You are the same as me, if i have 1000000 $ i would feel so empty because i dont know what to do with it, and i don't want people to look at me as a rich guy. "
p11
aS'If you do not want to earn more, take some cash out and buy a house or a car or you may organize you own business in real life. Othewise, just have some fun. And remember not to keep all eggs in one basket.'
p12
aS"600Kcrypto - I'm roughly 15 years older than you - 40. The time is going to rush by for you - 26 today - 45 tomorrow.I make my living as a vulture investor -always looking for what is underpriced and cheap. But also I only buy things which produce flows of cash through time. Cryptocurrency by definition is not an investment - it is a speculation (a bet on the future price of an asset). A key point to remember is that if you overpay a little for an investment you will most likely still make money in the long run because it produces cash every day/quarter/year. Reinvested cash, over and over - will make you insanely rich over the years.I buy stocks, commercial real estate (apartment complexes, mobile home parks) - and now for some diversification I am looking at putting maybe 1-2% of my portfolio in a small crypto mine (I have a commercial building sitting on land I own with great electricity prices in a cold climate). But I would never gamble my entire net worth on any one asset - once you are rich (and you are at the beginning stages of being rich) it is not worth it.$600K is a sum large enough to almost guarantee you will become truly rich over the years - and it is a sum you may have a very hard time saving up if you don't take steps to protect it NOW. Time is your friend - make 10-15% per year from now on out on that nest egg and you will be stupid rich while you are still young enough to enjoy it.You have done an amazing thing - accumulated a significant nest egg at a young age. My best advice to you would be to take your money off the table at this point. Find a nice mix of value stocks - or if you want something more active that can yield higher returns over time - get into commercial real estate. Find some underpriced small apartment complex or mobile home park around $1M in value, buy it with your $600K and then rapidly pay off the debt (should be 5 years if you buy correctly).When the debt is paid you should have yourself a multiunit building or trailer park of 50 lots or more which gives you a cash flow of greater than $100,000 USD per year for the REST OF YOUR GODDAMN LIFE.And you will be only 31 years old my friend.The beauty is you can go back to school maybe - or just keep working - in the mean time your money works for you. You will be 31 - prime of your life young man. You'll have a full time income from your job PLUS $100,000 per YEAR to REINVEST in a wide variety of cash producing assets - more apartments with higher leverage ('cause it's your second deal you can borrow more), value stocks, etc.You'll easily have $10M in today's money by age 50 - maybe 40 if you really hustle.But get your money out of crypto - you are WAYYYYYYYY too concentrated in an extremely speculative asset class.Get back in after a crash. Or at least reduce it to 10% or less of your holdings. Buy some mining gear at good prices if you like so you're actually producing the asset not just purchasing and speculating.With this plan you are almost guaranteed to become very very rich in life. If you stay in crypto at this point you are gambling with your money. You have a $600K nest egg - a GIGANTIC head start in the wealth game. Use it wisely.Also more advice:-STOP TALKING RIGHT NOW ABOUT YOUR GODDAMN WEALTH TO YOUR FRIENDS. NO GOOD CAN COME OF THAT.-Get educated - if you do not yet understand and are educated about modern portfolio theory and behavioral finance, economics and statistics - make it your biz to learn. For the record I don't believe MPT holds water but you need to know it because it underpins almost all financial advice given by pros (again I think they're wrong - I'm a value fan of Ben Graham and W Buffett). You MUST understand discounted cash flows, time value of money, net present value, internal rate of return and other core finance topics because they are the foundation of all wealth building and investment analysis - take a course at your local jr. college if you have to Best of luck - remember the #1 rule of investing is DON'T LOSE MONEY.The #2 rule is - SEE RULE 1."
p13
aS'Also - your friends are financial idiots - I can tell that by what you said about them. If they are telling you to buy a house, a car and "live a nice lifestyle" - they don\'t have money and don\'t know how much capital it really takes to "live a nice lifestyle." You can\'t do that on your returns safely until you hit low 8 figures (which you can at your age with your nest egg) net worth.Do not buy a house - buy a multiunit building - live in one unit, rent the rest. Thereby you both get a great cash producing investment and you also eliminate your housing expense completely - accelerating the race to more wealth.'
p14
aS'Last few hours bitcoin value seems reduced in the price chart so you can check and invest with the complete 600k USD or with the half of the fund in ethereum and bitcoin splitted each other. There are many people turns to altcoins so you can invest on bitcoin and I think your investment will boost the price for some little cost at least in the price chart. So wait for sometime.'
p15
aS'Lucky dog!!I think you already have the answer,you say the XRB and PRL can double easily.So, I think you should hold them without doubt.And the other,you can sell a half to getmore cash!If the whole market goes down,you can get more coins,on the other side,ifthe market keep bull,you also can earn pretty much profit with XRB and PRL.Above is my opinion!Finally,you have to make a decision by yourself.'
p16
aS'Will ,everyone of us here\xc2\xa0 have a different opinion,but if you ask me now my opinion what should i do,if that\xc2\xa0 lucky things happen to me, will im not giving up my trading,but i withdraw some of my investment to buy all what i want and\xc2\xa0 buy a house and lot for my siblings shelter,and providing all that there needs,because all of this graces given from heaven,so i want\xc2\xa0 to share it to my family,and give some few things to the orphanage foundation and church donation.all this things planning i want to do this,if that happen to me in the future Gods grace given to me.'
p17
aS'Just be smart. Take small % off the table the more milestones you hit.For example, with 600k why not take 10% off the table and keep it in FIAT. If the market crashed you have some chips on the sidelines to get in even heavier at lower prices. This is the way I would play it. I would never cash out 100%. '
p18
aS'Nice amount of profit and I like your top coins, I would definitely have to take at least 25% out and think about how the tax situation works in your country just to be safe and avoid any hassle.'
p19
aS"Wow thanks for all your help guys. looks like I have some responding to do! As for my plan, I am taking out 30k, my intial investment was 10k in 2014, so I am 3x up no matter what happens now. I am going to buy a nice car and have a nice holiday this summer with my money.I will diversify my portfolio with a few top 10 coins, IOTA and Cardano look good to me. I think Bitcoin and the Alts will ebb and flow a lot this year, so plan on moving most of my funds back into Bitcoin when I see a bullrun commence (I think this will be around mid 2018 when other big banks start offering investments into BTC) once the bullrun has ended, I will flip back into Altcoins and hopefully make a tidy return. I will keep you all posted on how it turns out for me\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Thanks, this is the advice I will follow dude!Lucky? No. I didn't accidentally buy Bitcoin, and I didn't accidentally trade it for PRL and XRB, I did my research and backed coins I saw had potential to grow. I have never touched any crypto money yet, though I ordered a Bitcoin Debit Card last night and sold some Bitcoin-Cash I had on an old wallet. In my country there is no capital gains tax on Bitcoin yet, so I dont need to worry about that. I am diversifying my portfolio now, thank you for your help. Thank you so much more your kind advice, I will look into all you spoke of in great detail, as I need to think of an exit plan soon I believe, on a small note, I dont discuss my wealth with my friends, my family, my friends and colleagues - none of them have any idea I have these assets, only 2 people know, one friend is a lot older than me and doesnt understand crypto at all, but he puts so much FUD in me its untrue, now everytime I see him he is asking if I have sold it yet.

p22
aS'Why you are think for quiting in crypto if this thing will helps you to make your life much better or you do not like what youve received in investing on digital currency. Also i am thinking if you are one of the person who are in crypto for couple of year i am sure you are already here in the forum for more couple of years also because based on your statement you have lots of knowledge about crypto and i am sure that this forum has much more information to collect about our new generation currency.'
p23
aS"i wonder why in your portfolio bitcoin only have 1.5% from your total asset because admitted or not bitcoin could be provide good profit since the price was jumping last year and i think you have to increase the percentages asset for bitcoin because i'm pretty sure holding bitcoin even for long term will get very much benefit but Raiblocks also good as this coin was jumping rapidly and i personally didn't expect this coin will reach at the current price"
p24
aS'If i were you i would sell some and the others play crypto. In this way youll have money for making more money and money for usage.'
p25
aS"Why don't you sell half of it?So you won't regret if price crash. Just remember one thing - it become money only after you cash out\xc2\xa0 "
p26
aS"You can see it from the profolio. 600kcrypto is in for the short term. Top two holding which it's 83% of the portfolio are new project from 2017 and a risk taker for sure will to lose it all. Good for him that he made it. Sell it and enjoy the profit."
p27
aS'I would withdraw 300.000$ and the other 300.000$ it would be 30% NEO, 30% QSP, 40% BTC'
p28
aS'A "nice lifestyle" is relative. I don\'t think an 8-figure net worth is necessary to live well. I also don\'t think a house and car are bad purchases. A house is a solid investment, and even in a housing crash, your house\'s value is far less likely to evaporate like altcoin gains. Altcoin gains can disappear overnight, so putting money into "real" assets is a smart move for someone whose portfolio is 100% crypto. You can\'t eliminate your housing expense completely: property taxes. And property taxes tend to be significantly higher on multi-family buildings than single-family. Also, being a landlord can be a real headache. You have to deal with evicting non-paying tenants, landlord-tenant lawsuits, you have to regularly find occupants (or pay realty agents to do so), you need to do building repairs and deal with city/county/state housing codes. A single oversight in purchasing a large building (regarding, say, seismic retrofitting or similar renovation) can set your ROI back years. Glad to hear that you are covering your initial investment and keeping some cash in the bank. Don\'t get too lavish with the car and holidays; those expenses can add up very quickly. '
p29
aS'This is definitely not the right time\xc2\xa0 to quit. More People are getting used to the crypto experience. I bet you may not make as much as 600K in the same time frame in the corporate world, unless you have a one-in-a-million idea to sell to the world. '
p30
aS'First of all I would like to congratulate you for your great achievement.I hope you have taken the right decision to take out only 30k from 600k after evaluating all the aspects.If you take out 500k and keep 100k for crypto investment, I think its enough for you to make another 1m within this year or by 2019.My best wishes for you - keep it up. And this time spread your money into more coins for more safe investments..'
p31
aS'i think you should withdraw some money and\xc2\xa0 buy some car or whatever you want to do. but dont withdraw all the money from the crypto currencies as i think 2018 will be an amazing year for the crypto world. i myself withdrew some money to make my living standard good as everyone want his living standard upgraded '
p32
aS"I think this year is Ripple's year."
p33
aS'\xc2\xa0in my own will, as long as i earn profit is just a time to go in the flow of crypto. dont quit as long as you earn. just quit when you lost all.'

aS'600k in Cryptocurrency Well this become an intriguing topic for everyone, it seems that the best advice that you have is from chemvidswoot.P.S If I were O.P I will execute the advice that chemvidswoot, and as O.P said he will look into it in a great depth. I reckon he is going to plan what chemvidswoot said, because a commercial building is excellent to make a ROI.\xc2\xa0 '
p35
aS"Watch out bro Ripple is falling,many people were trapped in ripple's hype and now the price is crashing under the earth.It is not a good idea to invest on a centralized coin.I think this is Ethereum's year and you already can see the price of ETH is going to moon."
p36
aS'Right now I would say that it will be good to invest in ETH, like some others has recommended here. It is quite a good investment since ETH has been one of the most developed coin in the cryptocurrency scene and has a lot of plans for this year. I am not sure though how will the community react to when the time comes that it shifts from POW to POS, whether it would raise the price or it would drop everything down due to the fact that we should remember that the Ethereum Foundation practically holds shit tons of ETH in their reserves which will result to them being the biggest miners in case POS is implemented. However that will still take a long time, probably it would take more than a year to happen. Before that time, I think prices could even triple or quadruple due unless Bitcoins upgrades itself.'
p37
aS'Ethereum is the good choice of crypto currencies to invest because this coin having high potential and possible to touch the position of bitcoin in the future. other than that the amount of this coin is affordable for many users, not like other crypto currency even bitcoin.'
p38
aS'I prefer to go for lower capped coins that hold real potential, Ripple I will never touch because I don\'t agree with the centralization aspect of the coin, and I think Raiblocks is actually a much better coin than ripple, plus is it truly decentralized. I would rather have a 43% stake in Raiblocks than Ripple for that reason. Like I mentioned, I will diversify my portfolio into a few more top 10 coins, and Ether will be one of them. If anyone is reading this and is unaware of Raiblocks, Oyster Pearl or Enigma, I suggest you read into them. All very insteresting projects that could have a big future. I am aware that it is a risky game I am playing, but I feel confident I know what I am doing. I Hodl\'d my BTC through thick and thin for 4 years before I was happy with the return and am happy to do the same for the Altcoins I believe in, I agree a little diversification will make my portfolio "safer".Just to be clear as well, I am 100% believer in blockchain technology and even if I were worth $600,000,000 I would still have large stakes of my money in crypto, as I think it is the future.Oh and for anyone that commented saying I don\'t sound a newb to the forum, I am not I hold a hero member status on another profile, but I wanted to be a bit more anonymous when talking about a delicate topic like this\xc2\xa0  '
p39
aS'I personally would never quit if i have had already earned that much through trading, but I would have converted some of it to fiat and would have already started living my desired life without any further wasting of time because we never know what happens tomorrow.You should divide your assets in two parts. Make them 70%-30% or 80%-20% and use the lower part for yourself and the bigger part of further investments and trading. After one year again, do the same, and continue the process. It will make your life a lot easier.'
p40
aS"That is imaginable because your arguments seem to have some weight, but to lend credence to it all and probably spur up couple of frightened forks as well as some snoozing giants in here, attaching some proof, would be more like it!Regards when to quit trading, I think it's never! No good football coach changes a winning team, so if trading is your ace, why want to quit! As for me, by whatever time I would be ready to retire, one of my offsprings most have become interested and ready to carry on. At 600k, my focus would narrow down to consolidation and my form of diversification would be to channel some coins into mining of my top holdings - Bitcoin, of course is exempted till a farm is probably in place."
p41
aS'that is great to hear.you are already rich and very successful here because of the crypto currency. if i were you, you should still continue until you are married. '
p42
aS'Make the decision based on what it is best for yourself, if your friends are not crypto traders do not take their opinion, they do not know what they are talking about, in my opinion you should sell only a portion of your stash so you can improve your life and feel better about holding the rest.'
p43
aS'why would you he quit bitcoin its still rising its like he has a property in a tourism area.keeps rising all the time'
p44
aS'You are right, why we should stop if we do see that this thing could really benefit us even more? $600k for me wont really be enough for me to stop. As long i can able to generate income with my skills then theres no stopping as of now and i dont know why arent you grateful on your skills, these have been hoping by most people because they do know this thing would really be good for long term and can really make your rich or changed your entire life since you do know on how to trade up.'
p45
aS"is 600k worth a lot where you live?A serious question, because you can't retire on 600k in the US.If it is a lot, then retire. At 25. Once retired, give me daily advice on how to do better, in other words: manage a % of my portfolio\xc2\xa0 (big name for a small pile)"
p46
aS'Earning that amount is not yet time to say that you will call it quits. You still have a lot to do in life and more than likely that amount is not sufficient if you will live a good life with your own family. Unless you want to live a very simple and quiet life in the suburbs.'
p47
aS"I agree with the opinion about XRP, right now I believe the price of XRP has been mainly driven by the its hype and nothing really about the project itself. People moved out of bitcoins right now as a normal consequence of its recent incredible price pump and could not have sustained itself at that price level. Another factor is that the problems with its network as well as the fees has driven off a lot of users. Probably bitcoins will pump by the time a fork is again introduced.Railblocks has been indeed interesting, I've read about it since last year, though I never thought it would grow this much. I was looking at it before at the price of $0.14 and it has grown about $30 a piece. I wish I invested in this too back then."
p48
aS'I live in a super expensive European city, 600k barely buys a flat! (Think stockholm / Oslo / London/ Geneva sort of expensive!) Will be a while before I retire.....'
p49
aS'Yes, really strange and risky portfolio. You are really lucky if you made yours 600k.\xc2\xa0 At your place i would fix the part (may be 30%) of portfolio in Dollars/Euro (to keep safe) and other part to review, otherwise you can lose everything. You should empower you portfolio.'
p50
aS'Monero would be the perfect hideout for your coins. No rich list, no pesky authorities... But also, no way to spend it really, so ... nope, not a good idea. '
p51
aS'For me it would be all about financial security, I just started and if I ever make it to 1 Million (or even 600k as they guy wrote), I would probably sell part of itto cover my mortgage and debts and trade with the rest of it.'
p52
aS'Can just agree, it is just starting off, I think also the next couple of years will be good with crypto.\xc2\xa0 One of my friends made a lot of money with crypto and his initial investment was under 10k.He might just cash out on some and keep the rest. '
p53
aS'OP must be a teen ager or I assume he is still underestimating the potentials of crypto currencies. Yes, we may leave off all other coins but we can still keep believing into bitcoins for another decade or even for another half century too.I like to suggest OP to quit his altcoins and can have all of them into bitcoins to hold for years. Just 600k dollars will be nothing in my opinion when considering the upcoming boom in bitcoin price levels. I need to agree some altcoins also will boom still bitcoin will continue its dream running to another extend.'
p54
aS'Living from playing trading is not a wise decision. You certainly will never be satisfied with what you have before everything runs out. My advice is to sell some of your assets and start enjoying the results of your hard work during this time. Is not the result worth your effort. If you still want to save the coins then just hold XRB and PRL whether it will be boom or not, it will not affect your other money.'
p55
aS'You are no doubt very much lucky that you have this much of earning from bitcoin and that too in such a short period of time. There are still number of people who are not unable to make anything good from bitcoin. I must suggest you not to quit this thing as this can really help you in having far more money in the future as well. You need to continue your investment into bitcoin for having more money.'

aS'You surely are aware that there are tokens out there that produce dividends such as Bankera, Spectrocoin, Astro, Neo, Waves.... I am surprised of what I am reading.'
p58
aS'With that kind of capital, you can invest a lot of money in this market. I feel that to get that money you are a very professional investor and your current job. You need to optimize how much money you have as much as possible. I am really impressed that you are quite young and have a lot of capital in hand.'
p59
aS'save the many to made 1 million more so you can build your own foundation to give someone else a decent job and you will be a bos '
p60
aS'May be he would not like to take more risk now as he has make a huge amount of money and should sustain easily for the next few years and may be what OP can do is withdraw 50 % of the money to be on safer side and invest the rest in other coins to get returns.'
p61
aS'simply earning that much is calling quits already..'
p62
aS"Surely OP didn't expected what's happening now in his life like it didn't sink it yet that's why he's quite unsure if it's the right to do. I agree with your advice to OP by just selling the half and diversify it evenly and the rest just save up or open up a business that you can use for fronting so others won't question your money.Anyway, OP you have a impressive portfolio and you're lucky that you bought yoyr coins before it boom and these coins are doing good lately."
p63
aS'I must say that if you are earning this much amount of money, then it is not to quit. In fact, you can go for having more money as you know the trick of making more money in this field and that it can help you in having more money than your current earnings. Quitting will result in nothing more profitable and that it will stop all your earnings. So, think well and then make some good decision.'
p64
aS'No need to quit bro,if you have made huge money in crypto then why you are leaving.You can cashout your profit amounts then start again with little bit of investment or invest in some altcoins which will give you more profits in 2018.'
p65
aS'It is not bad however to take a bit instead of staying all in. After all this is a risky market and if thing go south you may very well get a psychological impact if you loose an amount of money means something to you. '
p66
aS'You should really think off to build a physical business or offline businesses so that people wont really question you on your sudden progress when it comes to financial not only be means of avoiding possible conflict to others but also diversification is always a best choice for you to generate even more possible income.It isnt really bad to secure profits and playing safe. though.'
p67
aS'I absolutely hate it when a bunch of people in a crypto forum talk about paying taxes. I understand americans who are afraid from the tax men, and maybe some top 5 europeans. (german, brit etc.)But guys come on, I taught people got into crypto to say FUCK YOU to these old world establishments. Best'
p68
aS'This is a pretty good advice. If 2018 is similar to 2017 then your 300k in raiblocks easily will become a million dollars.'
p69
aS"It all depends on what are your financial goals. If you're ok with what you have right now, then cash it out. But don't sell everything, keep at least 10% in crypto and let it grow. Personally, I would reinvest all my gains in other crypto or ICOs. Im pretty sure 2017 will be big. "
p70
aS"How much did you spend on the crypto?Take at least double that in profits.Both crypto and the stock market have gone up to unprecedented levels; I stronglysuspect a retraction will occur in both within 5 years, but timing the market is afools game.\xc2\xa0 Decide on your taking profit levels and stick to them.With those gains, diversify further into assets that generate income monthly, e.g., bonds,mutual funds that invest in bonds (Pimco & Vanguard have some decent funds here),rental properties, etc.If you want to remain in crypto, redistribute some of the remaining profits intoProof of Stake coins (if ETH ever gets around to implementing it; that's probablya good one)--this way all you need is to leave on your computer and itwill mine more coins for you (no ASIC hardware and massive amounts of powerrequired)."
p71
aS'You can give me a little, so that it would be easier on the soul)))'
p72
aS"OP 600k are just little you need to work more i think spend more time here in forum so you can earn again like that and i think base on your constructive post we need you here but that's your life do what you want i give only suggestion or option another thing if you have that kind of money i think i build a business by that for more secure and more good to my families future."
p73
aS"Would the 600K profit enough for you? It depends on your decision. You have the control when to stop and still go on. 600K is a big amount of money, but I don't think it is still enough."
p74
aS"Exactly... Congratulations on winning that amount. You must have invested and risked quite a bit to get it.. I don't think 600k would be good enough for retirement though, so reinvesting would be a good idea"
p75
aS"Yes, even though we have huge amount it is not possible for us to withdraw them immediately because government\xc2\xa0 will demand more tax for your withdrawal. So we don't have any other choice."
p76
aS"I invested about 10k, and am taking out 30k. Am Hodling the rest. Diversifying slowly, my coins have taken a real hammering lately, (as has everyone's), which is fine. Am happy Hodling \xc2\xa0I can withdraw over $100,000 a week through coinbase where I am, but, like I said, am Hodling for now.\xc2\xa0I have been active on this forum for a long time already, I just set up this newb account to discuss money, I don't want people knowing how much I have on my other account, as people get jealous. I already have my own company my friend "

aS"No no no, don't call it quits. Just still continue making money with your bitcoin. Just don't stop and continue to make money with the crypto currency world. "
p78
aS'Quitter never wins. I think he knows what he is doing, so if he can make money before he can still make more money in the future. I say get some out of crypto, invest on real estates. Retain 75% in crypto and make it grow more.'
p79
aS'With 600k capital, you have a lot of opportunities to invest in this market, I think you can invest in good ICO projects, which is the trend of this market. You can also keep yourself a part of your daily commissions for more income, but remember to keep a fixed amount of money so you can redeem yourself when the coin is unlucky reduce value.'
p80
aS'My idea also just keep making money from crypto currencies rather than quitting from it completely. Because we cannot be sure what is going to happen tomorrow and instead of looking for any consistent money making from crypto currency world, deciding to quit must be a bad decision in my opinion.Making 600k into million would be the right option in front of OP. Because there could be lot of opportunities we can find with cryptos now a days. Just repeating what has given him 600k will be more than enough rather than looking for new opportunities.'
p81
aS"Congrats on your nest egg. I don't think it's time to quit anytime soon. This year is going to be big and smart investors will be rewarded."
p82
aS"Reading the replies of OP it seems that he made up his mind and never call it a quits and just planning to hold some and diversify the rest and it's a good and wise move to do. Cryptos are just starting its era so it's too early to call it quits and I think no one in the right mind will quit when he knew that he can profit big."

There are no good Samaritans these days, nobody would even give you an ordinary $5. Well, some are good, but they\xc2\x92re hard to find.I don\xc2\x92t know where this guy is leaving, maybe the 600k is worth a millions or billions in his own currency. But, I wouldn\xc2\x92t quit in 600k. Even if I hit $100 million today, that wouldn\xc2\x92t make me stop, I will still be working hard.'
p84
aS'Yeah, common ! I mean, I see no reason for OP to quit too. He has built a good start that some of us wish to have got to & with 26 age, he has fresh energy to go all out for diversification. As rightly said , cryptos are just starting up, he could build more money since he already has the capital .In my view, I think he should split into two, invest one part in real estate and then sell off some of the coin that have got to there highs and then buy cheaper coins with good tendencies for growth in the future. Meanwhile, I hope he is keeping his securities and code save, also disclosing to a trusted party - just incase. '
p85
aS"It doesn't mean that rank newbie is the basis of not having coins in crypto currency world, there are also types of person who is inside this forum, some of them are traders , gamblers, investors, and so many more, maybe you were shock that such an individual already have that huge amount, but, maybe you're thinking wrong about OP. \xc2\xa0Many millionaires in the outside world and their source of income is from crypto but is not here in the forum. P.S. I think OP should HODL 50% of all of the tokens/coins he have, and then the 50 should be keep on rolling. Investing, or trading. Then you'll be sitting pretty in the right time schedule."

p87
aS'Exactly! The one who has managed to earn this much amount of money is no doubt really a lucky person. I don\xc2\x92t think so that he should quit all this thing as he knows the trick of making money and he can use the similar kind of technique in the future as well in order to make more money. Bitcoin can for sure later on make him the world\xc2\x92s richest person if he continued doing working hard in future as well.'
p88
aS'In what way is being active on bitcointalk related to how much money you make on cryptocurrencies?'
p89
aS'Exactly!It is the individual himself who has to make the decision. For me, if someone has managed to earn this much of money and that too in such a short period of time, then he should keep working hard in the future as well. This will for sure help him in making of more money as he is having this much of experience that he will then be able to make more money in the coming days.'
p90
aS'My personal suggestion for someone who has earned this much amount of money by being in the world of bitcoin is that if he continues to do the very same thing which he was doing since past few years, then there are like chances that he will be able to make double money than what he has earned so far. Quitting this business makes no sense and that too at time when it is helping you make money.'
p91

p92
aS'For that amount of money you do not need to quit early since you are only 26 years old that money can be spend easily and loose it quickly, until you can earn in trading you should continue the good work and save more money for your future.

p96
aS"I think it all depends on what you want to do with the money and your risk profile. If you're at a comfy place right now, i'd recommend waiting for another year to see how it goes. After all, i think 2018 will be a great year for crypto."
p97

aS"When you need advice for this, I guess you might be consider to do any other job than trading on crypto. What I believe is that every person have their talent to do many things that might be consider as their job. You should do with joy when decide to quit and choose the other job. You have enough money to doing some business by the way. Why don't you keep you trading activity to the small part of your life and do business. If you good enough at some point, buying a house from your business will not take any longer."
p99
aS"Still i can't believe you've not taking it into capital gains from what you've earn you could sell some and reinvest with the growth of XRB and PRL. The market is in red now if you'd sell a half of it before, you could have comeback and diversify your investment from short term and long term put more money into long term tokens and plan on a capital gains and exit plan."
p100
aS"I think, that you should not sell it right now and stop your crypto marathon. Market is still growing, and at least in 2018 we will see a good growh for all perspective coins. You can take some percents from your stack and try to invest in ICO. There are a lot of good projects, which gains X's"
p101
aS"You really need to withdraw atleast 200k and get out of the apartment and buy a house and treat yourself with good things. Now that you are in the first phase of earning money. The next step is hard, which is to manage and multiply the money. Don't be a one time wonder, you gotta invest more carefully and take calculated risks having the remaining 400k as base and multiply it. You can lead a good to great life. "
p102

You are no doubt going very well in the world of crypto currencies and if you continue to do the same in the future too, you will for sure be able to make some very good amount of money and that your dream of getting rich will definitely come true.

aS'Invest in a good DPOS coin like ARK then live off your DPOS gains. $600k of ARK at current prices wold give you approx 45 ARK a day in DPOS , worth around $200 now.In a year you will prob be getting $1000+ a day worth!!!'
p113
aS'It depends on where you live if you are in a first world country that is not enough to retire, but it is a good start especially if he is young, but in a third world country that amount is a small fortune and enough to live the rest of your live if you invest it and live out of the profits of your investments, however it is too soon to leave the market there is still a lot of money to be made for the smart investor.'

aS'Why you are think for quiting in crypto if this thing will helps you to make your life much better or you do not like what youve received in investing on digital currency. Also i am thinking if you are one of the person who are in crypto for couple of year i am sure you are already here in the forum for more couple of years also because based on your statement you have lots of knowledge about crypto and i am sure that this forum has much more information to collect about our new generation currency.'
p119
aS"i wonder why in your portfolio bitcoin only have 1.5% from your total asset because admitted or not bitcoin could be provide good profit since the price was jumping last year and i think you have to increase the percentages asset for bitcoin because i'm pretty sure holding bitcoin even for long term will get very much benefit but Raiblocks also good as this coin was jumping rapidly and i personally didn't expect this coin will reach at the current price"
p120
aS'If i were you i would sell some and the others play crypto. In this way youll have money for making more money and money for usage.'
p121
aS"Why don't you sell half of it?So you won't regret if price crash. Just remember one thing - it become money only after you cash out\xc2\xa0 "
p122
aS"You can see it from the profolio. 600kcrypto is in for the short term. Top two holding which it's 83% of the portfolio are new project from 2017 and a risk taker for sure will to lose it all. Good for him that he made it. Sell it and enjoy the profit."
p123
aS'I would withdraw 300.000$ and the other 300.000$ it would be 30% NEO, 30% QSP, 40% BTC'
p124
aS'A "nice lifestyle" is relative. I don\'t think an 8-figure net worth is necessary to live well. I also don\'t think a house and car are bad purchases. A house is a solid investment, and even in a housing crash, your house\'s value is far less likely to evaporate like altcoin gains. Altcoin gains can disappear overnight, so putting money into "real" assets is a smart move for someone whose portfolio is 100% crypto. You can\'t eliminate your housing expense completely: property taxes. And property taxes tend to be significantly higher on multi-family buildings than single-family. Also, being a landlord can be a real headache. You have to deal with evicting non-paying tenants, landlord-tenant lawsuits, you have to regularly find occupants (or pay realty agents to do so), you need to do building repairs and deal with city/county/state housing codes. A single oversight in purchasing a large building (regarding, say, seismic retrofitting or similar renovation) can set your ROI back years. Glad to hear that you are covering your initial investment and keeping some cash in the bank. Don\'t get too lavish with the car and holidays; those expenses can add up very quickly. '
p125
aS'This is definitely not the right time\xc2\xa0 to quit. More People are getting used to the crypto experience. I bet you may not make as much as 600K in the same time frame in the corporate world, unless you have a one-in-a-million idea to sell to the world. '
p126
aS'First of all I would like to congratulate you for your great achievement.I hope you have taken the right decision to take out only 30k from 600k after evaluating all the aspects.If you take out 500k and keep 100k for crypto investment, I think its enough for you to make another 1m within this year or by 2019.My best wishes for you - keep it up. And this time spread your money into more coins for more safe investments..'
p127
aS'i think you should withdraw some money and\xc2\xa0 buy some car or whatever you want to do. but dont withdraw all the money from the crypto currencies as i think 2018 will be an amazing year for the crypto world. i myself withdrew some money to make my living standard good as everyone want his living standard upgraded '
p128
aS"I think this year is Ripple's year."

aS'600k in Cryptocurrency Well this become an intriguing topic for everyone, it seems that the best advice that you have is from chemvidswoot.P.S If I were O.P I will execute the advice that chemvidswoot, and as O.P said he will look into it in a great depth. I reckon he is going to plan what chemvidswoot said, because a commercial building is excellent to make a ROI.\xc2\xa0 '
p131
aS"Watch out bro Ripple is falling,many people were trapped in ripple's hype and now the price is crashing under the earth.It is not a good idea to invest on a centralized coin.I think this is Ethereum's year and you already can see the price of ETH is going to moon."
p132
aS'Right now I would say that it will be good to invest in ETH, like some others has recommended here. It is quite a good investment since ETH has been one of the most developed coin in the cryptocurrency scene and has a lot of plans for this year. I am not sure though how will the community react to when the time comes that it shifts from POW to POS, whether it would raise the price or it would drop everything down due to the fact that we should remember that the Ethereum Foundation practically holds shit tons of ETH in their reserves which will result to them being the biggest miners in case POS is implemented. However that will still take a long time, probably it would take more than a year to happen. Before that time, I think prices could even triple or quadruple due unless Bitcoins upgrades itself.'
p133
aS'Ethereum is the good choice of crypto currencies to invest because this coin having high potential and possible to touch the position of bitcoin in the future. other than that the amount of this coin is affordable for many users, not like other crypto currency even bitcoin.'
p134
aS'I prefer to go for lower capped coins that hold real potential, Ripple I will never touch because I don\'t agree with the centralization aspect of the coin, and I think Raiblocks is actually a much better coin than ripple, plus is it truly decentralized. I would rather have a 43% stake in Raiblocks than Ripple for that reason. Like I mentioned, I will diversify my portfolio into a few more top 10 coins, and Ether will be one of them. If anyone is reading this and is unaware of Raiblocks, Oyster Pearl or Enigma, I suggest you read into them. All very insteresting projects that could have a big future. I am aware that it is a risky game I am playing, but I feel confident I know what I am doing. I Hodl\'d my BTC through thick and thin for 4 years before I was happy with the return and am happy to do the same for the Altcoins I believe in, I agree a little diversification will make my portfolio "safer".Just to be clear as well, I am 100% believer in blockchain technology and even if I were worth $600,000,000 I would still have large stakes of my money in crypto, as I think it is the future.Oh and for anyone that commented saying I don\'t sound a newb to the forum, I am not I hold a hero member status on another profile, but I wanted to be a bit more anonymous when talking about a delicate topic like this\xc2\xa0  '
p135
aS'I personally would never quit if i have had already earned that much through trading, but I would have converted some of it to fiat and would have already started living my desired life without any further wasting of time because we never know what happens tomorrow.You should divide your assets in two parts. Make them 70%-30% or 80%-20% and use the lower part for yourself and the bigger part of further investments and trading. After one year again, do the same, and continue the process. It will make your life a lot easier.'

S'Hi all,I would like to know if you see some business opportunities in Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency in real market. You can report real case of local business opportunity, for example ATM machines, advisory activites, support to business, lottery, etc...that you have seen in your country or abroad, and that can be easily followed at the own country.\xc2\xa0'
p1
aS'Definitely, Bitcoin has provided the biggest opportunities for doing business from a couple of years. it has been considering the latest addition of business hub. a lot of people have been engaged with this platform for making money with a very short time. day by day Bitcoin is getting accepted as a money in a various online platform. Bitcoin mining and trading are the most profitable system for earning a profit. in terms of investment, Bitcoin also can be considered as the best platform.'
p2
aS'I mean some single cases, to be proposed in any other country '
p3
aS'In the my country i dont have see any business opportunities in bitcoin, but i have seen that more and more people are interested to bitcoin and interested to invest/trade with themSo i think that in the next 1-2 years we can see ATM that can accept bitcoin like currency, and maybe we can pay at restaurant with bitcoin '
p4
aS'I am not expecting anything related to crypto implemented anytime soon in my country. '
p5
aS'In Philippines a lot of vendors now accept btc for their goods.'
p6
aS'But do people buy their goods using BTC in the Philippines? Please share the data on how many transactions per month that store receives in BTC compared to the transactions in cash and other banking means like debit and credit cards. I would say that 99.9% of those transactions received would be cash and debit/credit cards. So it makes BTC acceptance almost useless for the store.'
p7
aS'I am from Philippines but im sure this is not the case. Btc is not recognize nationwide in our country because of many reasons it is facing. We maybe from different regions but i doubt if just local btc would accept btc. We are in a country that is yet to be economize so it would be absurd to accept btc this time. The national bank acknowledged cryptocurrency but not as far as using as payment for the goods.'
p8
aS'Which country do you belong to and that is the current status of the government? Have they anytime commented or issued any notices relating to bitcoin or cypto currency? Our govt is also thinking if this needs to be legalized or ban but they have issued circular as a caution to investor which means its a risky business and should be dealt carefully.'
p9
aS'for me yes.Bitcoin has created a newly dimensioned business platform for us. with the development of technology, bitcoin has provided an organised and authentic system for several purposes. not only business purpose, you can use it a transaction system which provides a low rate transaction fees. but Bitcoin trading is the most vital platform for making a business in order to make a good return.'
p10
aS"Bitcoin itself is a business opportunity, how will you use it depends from only you. In my country there are couple ATM's already, and I heard about some shops that accepts bitcoins but I never saw it, its in capitol of my country. In my city I don't expect to see anything related with bitcoin anytime soon, I wish to start selling wines and some other drinks for bitcoin but I can't do anything, I posted couple times in local section but no one asked me nothing about it, and I doubt that I can sell anything for bitcoins in my country. I will need to think about something else, I would like to be first in something but it's not easy."
p11
aS"We have an ATM here in our country less than five in numbers, but I don't know if others are in operation. It is very far in my location and it is not advisable to try it because of the transportation cost to get there. So I'm contented to use the exchanges. The ATM should be placed in a 24hour store or petrol station for easy access."
p12
aS"There isn't any pure real market business in bitcoin exists as you are saying other than ATM machines, but today many of the retailers, stores and restaurants are accepting bitcoin as legal payment method so this could be the real market business of bitcoin because payment is paid in bitcoin here. Bitcoin ATM machines is somehow the only pure real market business in bitcoin because till now many of the countries or cities don't have any. "
p13
aS"Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as it is part of technology they're is a wide range of opportunities for this kinds of business to choose from. As a travelers ATM/bitcoin machine is the first and mostly look for when in othe country. But I would love to see cyberzone on malls or computer centers accepting bitcoin as an alternative for fiat. For now I'm into a small business on my local wallet, a loading station when at high price I converted it and as a capital for my online load center. I got almost 40% profit for 10$ a day. I know it is small but it was enough for me."
p14
aS"Idea is good because bitcoin is really big online market and large number of website accept bitcoin now. So yes if they provide more better way to change BTC into Cash or other things so it's really good for every Bitcoin user. "
p15
aS'This might one of the examples for people who would really use btc as an investment to make another income either IRL or in the web. As far as i know, btc exchanges differ in which country you are. So maybe before having a flight, one must research the country they are going to visit for any cryptoservices that could offer conversion to fiat.'
p16
aS"I even doubted myself for sometimes if those decisions i made are good or it is better just to HODL it for long time. But i think I'm good to go now, thanks for the recognition. This won't hurt anyone but I think I can even help those person who part of my loading station, they can earned the same way I do for promos I made. It comes to one reason really, why can't I shared the blessings that bitcoin brings to me than being selfish about it. I also teach them how to earned bitcoin for free to helped my fellow countrymen to get away from poverty individually."
p17
aS'There are several entrepreneurial opportunities that bitcoin offers and I have equally seen some but it all boils to the flexibility of the country one finds himself and the opportunities for market penetration in that line as well. Over here, there is gradual penetration of bitcoin into the teeming youths especially and its a market thats is worth penetrating. However, there is need for serious orientation because a lot of them got to know about bitcoin due to its acceptance as a form of currency in a popular failed ponzi scheme which makes it difficult to convince someone of how to go about it and even lazy for them to find out other uses of bitcoin aside for ponzi.What I see as a ripe avenue currently is to create a freelancing site that accepts bitcoin as a form of currency and with that they see more potentials and earn bitcoin for their effort and indirectly create a new market for those who wants to convert to fiat and vice versa.'
p18
aS"I'm seeing loading station as one of the benefits of having btc in the Philippines because coins.ph can be use as such. I myself have tried to do it and its very beneficial to me as well. I used my bitcoin earning and my laptop (instead of the traditional cellphone) as my loading station. Yes, it is really small amount but I guess money is money. And was able to put up a mini grocery for my father and mother in law so that they will not get bored and have a least some money to buy medicines and put food in the table. They are now financially independent as well."
p19
aS"Business opportunities for bitcoin is much bigger, because the upcoming generations will be completely functional on digital platform. Whether it's something related to technology or some other form of usage doesn't matter. Next is the profit expectations, for one to be successful in business its good to add bitcoin as an platform to the conventional way of business."
p20
aS'YES it is true , bitcoin provide a huge oppurtunities for everyone. Students, unemployed worker and even those already employed is in this community. Why ? Because here they can earn an extra income that may help them in their daily lives. And if that can be consider a business then probably its a good opportunity for business.'
p21
aS'Yes, I agree with these the foods is the best thing that we can buy/sell to bitcoins it will be in demand because people are always consuming their basic necessities. If you have any idea on how it will be execute (in business that you pertain) that will be an in demand idea for all! Hope for the future of bitcoins and it will lead its way! Good luck to all of you! '
p22
aS"What bitcoin offer is fast transaction and cashless, if ever transaction fees will be less in the future i think businesses will opened its door on cryptocurrency. That is a big possibility as what technology and Blockchain can offer is worth the try. Even if I do have now an existing business I would have done it, it can be advantageous to me as prices of bitcoin still increasing and I would HODL it. So I'm a businessman and an investor the same time. A great combination indeed."
p23
aS"If you are starting as a bitcoin enthusiast then you've got a lot of choice for bitcoin business opportunities. As you had mentioned the ATM machines, if you live in a country where people aren't recognizing bitcoin then you will be the pioneer business to open a bitcoin ATM. Here in my country only one bitcoin ATM nationwide was installed because very few are believing on this thing that's why if you are the first one to start, you'll be successful."
p24
aS'Definitely, Bitcoin is the new and most profitable business sector. From here, anyone can gain much profit if he or she can learn properly about the system and market. if someone has the capability for predicting about the market situation then it can be very easy to make a large amount of profit. there are a lot of options of involving with this system. trading and mining are the most profitable platform in terms of Bitcoin. but regarding doing well in this sector you just have the passion about this system.'
p25
aS"I agree that Bitcoin serves as a new business opportunity. Bitcoin is a currency yet with the services it provides us it definitely not just make transactions faster but used as flexible commodity. It is a currency but with its characteristics, it is very profitable. It's not a job but income is the best part of having bitcoins."
p26
aS'Same as you bitcoin helped me a lot to stat my own business. It is now supported by the people who have invested the whole capital of their income. Bitcoin is the best business by itself as invest in bitcoin and buy some bitcoin today wait for some time and then sell when you will see the price of the bitcoin is high enough. To help you start a new business for you.'
p27
aS'In your opinion, what are the best start-up that can esily have success with bitcoin and cripto in general.For example:1. Advisory activities to clients unfit with new technology2. Retail point of sale bitcoin - cripto currency3. Technical Service to business activities in order to ease bitcoin/cripto payments4. OthersIt would help to list real opportunities that you have seen and thta can be replicate in every country.\xc2\xa0 '
p28
aS"Definitely, Bitcoin is the new and modern dimensional business opportunity. anybody can do well in this system if he or she has a little bit information or market idea. there are some good options to do make the profit very easily. for me, Bitcoin trading is the best system for making money very easily. if you don't have any money then you can earn Bitcoin by joining the Signature Campaign. so that you can be benefitted very easily if you get involved with Bitcoin."
p29
aS"Yes, creating a local exchange in your local area will bring high profit if you are interested. In my place, it's not just an exchanger for btc to fiat but also you can buy digital goods using btc because a lot of gaming companies like steam accept btc."
p30
aS'in my country bitcoin not supported good Because till now it not make real effect but as general ATM machines good one'
p31
aS'Definitely, Bitcoin is becoming a new dimensional business platform. you can invest here with a low amount of money, you can trade with your money on this platform. You also can save your Bitcoin for the future purpose. if you think that you have an expert team then you can start a Mining project which will bring you a lot of money. so you can say that Bitcoin platform is a highly profitable business platform at current perspective.'
p32
aS"I agree with you. Im from Philippines and the first statement was completely not true because you can actually count shops that are accepting bitcoin as a mode of payment in you hands. 7/11 is a popular one. But i doubt you can buy goods with bitcoins there. You need to convert them to cash to buy all you want. I can't blame them for not accepting bitcoin because it will affect their business because on how bitcoin behaves. I don't think it's ideal to use in shops. It's volatile in nature. The profitability of your business is in question. Also not convinient for customers since you have to pay for other fee(transaction fee) just to give your payment. But it will be good if they really accepts bitcoin. That would be cool."
p33
aS'So far i dont see any physical stablishment or merchant business that offers product or services\xc2\xa0 that accept bitcoin as payment method. I use to see a few number of bitcoin ATM kiosk but only few people use it..here we often use local wallet to send and recieve bitcoin and convert it to fiat aside from that it has features were you can pay your bills, buy load cards and buy some stuff online.'
p34
aS'Yes it is providing a few empolyment opportunities but I dont know for how long are these going to last as frankly when the whole economy shifts to bitcoin we are actually going to remain on the same page as we are today.'
p35
aS'bitcoin is a business opportunity how you take advantage how you use and utilize depends on you.'
p36
aS"Well, i obviously see a lot of business opportunities with Bitcoin, but unfortunately i don't see any of them happening around me. I have never heard of a news of any Bitcoin activity going on within my country, and i really want that to happen in future. In other countries, there are shops accepting bitcoins, now even universities and some other educational institutes have started accepting bitcoins in some countries. So for sure, bitcoin provides a very large platform for businesses if someone is willing to use it."
p37
aS'Obviously, Bitcoin is becoming a great platform for making the profit by taking a risk. if someone wants to take a risk then Bitcoin platform would be the most profitable business opportunity at present. if you think that you are enough lucky then you can join in the Bitcoin gambling, also Bitcoin trading also good for earning bitcoin. so overall Bitcoin system is becoming a golden opportunity regarding Business.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0'
p38
aS'you can open a store or website and sell something there and pay with bitcoin. I think it is a new business opportunity that accepts payments using bitcoins. because there is still a bit of buying and selling that accept payments that use bitcoin.'
p39
aS"I don't have see any business opportunity in bitcoin in my country. But many people in my country like it and invest it. bitcoin popular in my country increase day by day. So my seems that next time we can see ATM bank that accept bitcoin."
p40
aS"Same with here I didn't see any news regarding on bitcoins implementation and adoption but we can still see some numerous of opportunities given with this coin, And you shouldn't wait for your country to accept this coin since the acceptance will start from you and you could bring up some people to this out and can able to give some opportunities by teaching them out on this. And expect that in future if bitcoins adoption will be good, there are business establishment will came up adopting bitcoins in good cause."
p41
aS"It's hard and even impossible to find things like that here in my country, bitcoin is not popular here and it's hard to open a business here about bitcoin. But the opportunities are many here but we need to courage people here to use bitcoin first. For ATM machines, i heard my country had 2 atm machines."
p42
aS'Well then i guess its better have some bitcoin via the web. Because not all people have trust in online businesses. Simply because they cant hold their own funds. It may the same as banks but at least having your own code to your wallet is much better than banks holding your own password. But its quite good for you to have atm machines for bitcoin because even in my place we dont have such services from bitcoin.'
p43
aS"Yes definitely, in fact many people has earned good amounts of profit in just a short amount of time more and more people are getting involved in this platform rather than fiat currency or investing in gold where you can earn quick money in ICO's, trading and lots of money making method. In fact bitcoin is a safe haven for long term investment and even surpassed gold recently. Bitcoin can be treated is an commodity or investment opportunity."
p44
aS'Ya!!!it is...bitcoin is a business opportunity for me since its gaining income'
p45
aS'It very well is an opportunity for people to earn huge amount of money with the help of Bitcoins ofcourse . It can help people engage in bringing about an entrepreneur in themselves '
p46
aS'The value of the bitcoins is all about the advantages and the disadvantages and the income with the bitcoin will be more than this so I would like to say that have the money and be the bitcoin men for the future I like the bitcoin for the sake of the huge income. I like the bitcoin because it is the best thing we have. The bitcoins is the business and the money will be more than this if we will use the only one currency.'
p47
aS'So many people have and so many people are still earning a lot daily from different forms of campaign and bounties. Although, this is more like an employment opportunity, but a whole lot of business has sprung up since the development of bitcoin, such as having a gambling website, rendering services and collecting bitcoin, ecommerce accepting bitcoin as payment and so on and so forth. it is just to find where you can stay relevant and make good use of it.'
p48
aS'Yes that is right that bitcoin as well as some other fiat currencies have the potential to give you good profit in a short time, that we even cannot think from our day trading or job. I think that those people who have invested money in bitcoin just a year before, now they can really get a good profit from it, and still they have the opportunities to increase their profit even more, if they continue holding their bitcoins. '
p49
aS'To all capitalist it is yes, because they were invest to create a business inside the crypto currency industry. Example of there are the trading sites, gambling sites, mining sites and lending. These are the business where investors want to grab the opportunities of investment.However to small people like us, we were used bitcoin as savings opportunities because they were save money to our bitcoin wallets. If necessary they also joined in business but in a small capital only.'
p50
aS'In fact, Bitcoin has provided many business opportunities. Job opportunities are most suitable for workers who work in the financial sector. If you have knowledge about finance and technology, we can partner with many entrepreneurs.'
p51
aS'Obviously bitcoin gives you a great opportunity to make profit. You can earn huge money from this platform. In this time many people are engaged with Bitcoin and they earn a lot of money. It has a great value now and it is accepted many businesses function. So you can go for work with Bitcoin.'
p52
aS'Check upwork.com guru.com are there many sites like these providing opportunities for freelancers and entrepreneurs. Once Dell announce that they can pay their salary in bitcoin. That I was been part of Dell in one country but no information kind of that from human resource team. Still whether this move has implemented there or somewhere. But if comes that is good salary comes investment for me.'
p53
aS"This is the best thing to do now when bitcoin services or adoption on your place is still low then better to spread awareness of bitcoin existence even just only the place or your vicinity which would really give others some opportunity to know bitcoin.It might be on small scale but somehow would add up on spreading the news.Actually ive been waiting for this thing to happen until into these days but I'm sure this will really happen and I would really be glad on using my bitcoin on the services I do know or even buying goods."
p54
aS'in my residence, indeed I have not found anyone who owns a business by using bitcoin.however I am interested in the business that has happened in swiss country. there is already a private university that receives a fee using bitcoin.in my opinion, we can do business as well as what happens in swiss, because in addition to universities can serve as business opportunities, also have other benefits that can make many people have the intelligence and science according to what they want by studying in the university.perhaps the view of people if doing business in an educational institution (including private universities) is less profitable. but for me personally, I prefer that kind of thing, because in addition to profiting in business, our bitcoin can also be useful by spending our money on a path that is beneficial to human life.\xc2\xa0 '
p55
aS"You do not have to do anything difficult to develop a bitcoin business. you can do a lot of ways like selling stuff online, I think that's a very easy thing and everyone can do it. the key is on the payment media that is done, you can receive bitcoin as payment of goods you sell. so bitcoins can be familiar and you have indirectly done business with bitcoin. I also started from simple things like and until now I already have an offline store that sells computer equipment and of course I receive a bitcoin payment at a store I have at a major computer shopping center in my country. it is my experience up to now and I feel happy to have been able to use bitcoin, I accept bitcoin as a bitcoin as well as payment that I get can be used as investment because I keep it for some time. those are two very profitable things for an investment and the little shop I have can continue to grow."
p56
aS"Hello, in my country bitcoin is restricted. But I believe in next 5 years, bitcoin is becoming legally payment method. It'll be accepted in purchasing at restaurants, ATM, clothing store and anything. At that time BTC payment will be very helpful for people in case of wallet or visa is out of money\xc2\xa0 "
p57
aS"Apparently, there's already a bitcoin ATM here in my country and luckily that means that our country is one of the supporters of bitcoin.This makes every bitcoin users to see a very big support to the community of cryptocurrency. And also there are some small startup businesses that are now willing to accept bitcoin.Also there are a lot of seminars that are being conducted by crypto groups that wants to raise the awareness about bitcoin."
p58
aS'bitcoin in my opinion is a new business opportunity that is very profitable like forex and stock, in my opinion more profitable and easier in doing transactions than on other types of investment. the right choice for investment'
p59

But i doubt you can buy goods with bitcoins there. You need to convert them to cash to buy all you want. I can't blame them for not accepting bitcoin because it will affect their business because on how bitcoin behaves. I don't think it's ideal to use in shops. It's volatile in nature. The profitability of your business is in question. Also not convinient for customers since you have to pay for other fee(transaction fee) just to give your payment. But it will be good if they really accepts bitcoin. That would be cool."

p1
aS"I'm afraid that no one is interested here with this offer, only some local on your place that uses bitcoin are possible to get an interest. If you don't mind, posting some images of your house, and some details, like storey, rooms, when it was built, etc."
p2
aS"that's why i asked there... Italy is always a shit when we talk about technology etc... :/ think about the thing that in my town the best internet connection is a medieval 7mbps adsl...... no more to say xD I think ill try your i dont mind solution"
p3
aS"You should get into contact with a real estate dealer and ask about the best way to approach this. I know there are some people who have sold their homes for crypto, but that seems like a pretty dangerous game to be playing.Anyhow, a real estate agent would probably be able to help you out with this. Worst case, you sell your house for fiat and use the fiat to buy bitcoin on an exchange or something; I don't see why that can't be an option either."
p4
aS"I don't think this is a good idea. Selling your house for bitcoin is really hard. There are still people who doesn't have bitcoin at all. And they even don't have any idea about bitcoin. Depend on your buyer, if your buyer owned bitcoin then that's good. But most of people still don't know about it. Why don't you just sell your house into fiat then just convert it into bitcoin. I think this is the fastest way to do and to sell."

aS'No, dont sell your house, are you crazy? Maybe sell your car or some of the\xc2\xa0things that you can live without, like fancy watches and jewelry, but not your HOUSE!Having that said, its people like you thats making BTC go higher and higher to its all time high. I dont know if I should be happy or sad lol.'
p6
aS'The objective is not being rich with bitcoin or crypto. Is just selling my house. Because we are trying to sell for about 2 years...with no luck. This kind of market in Italy is totally halted.Here is an image from tripadvisor...just to satisfy your curiosity\xc2\xa0 https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/e0/ec/43/bed-breakfast-villa-ali.jpg'
p7
aS"I wouldn't suggest you to sell something like your house, something that is very important for your living , for bitcoins.Bitcoin is very risky investment, and unless you have an extra house, I guess that you can't really afford to lose your house.Always consider risk management, and have a plan B, if bitcoin goes down, do you have somewhere to live?That's the question you should be asking yourself."
p8
aS"LOL. This is really crazy man )) For now I think it's really hard to find out anyone willing to buy your house with Bitcoin. I think you should try to create some advertisement about it. When anyone wanna buy your house by Bitcoin I think the safest way to make this deal is dealing face to face, escrow will not help in this case cause the amount of Bitcoin of this deal is too huge."
p9
aS' Are you sure you want to sell a house for bitcoin? I think if you do not have another house, I suggest do not sell it, most people look for bitcoin then sell it to buy a house ,,,, but if you want to sell your house, try advertising your home on the internet and on the road using stickers.'
p10
aS'just out of curiosity, for how much of BTC are you planning to sell it?'
p11
aS'Buying and selling house is difficult. You are trying to make it more difficult than it is already by using a medium of exchange that is just emerging. Its better you sell in your local currency and exchnage the money for bitcoin after.Thanks'
p12
aS'It may be better to sell your house through a property agent in Italy, once sold you can redeem the money from the sale of the house with bitcoin through a market you trust.'
p13
aS"There is a story of a man that he sold every possession he has and trade it in bitcoin when the price is 5$ per 1BTC and he lives like a homeless, but when bitcoin price is 40$ per bitcoin he sells half of his bitcoin possession.I don't know if the story is true or not, because that time I don't even know about bitcoin, I only heard the story to one of my friend."
p14
aS"If you want to sell the house with Bitcoin I will give you advice. For example, the value of the house is worth $ 100,000, if you sell your house 5 Bitcoins. When the price of bitcoin drops, you can sell your house cheaply. It would make more sense to say 'Bitcoin worth $ 100,000' to avoid this situation. So you will not be hurt by the instant Bitcoin price changes."
p15
aS'Get in touch with your local crypto communities that are interested to your house. Try to sell it on the goods section of this forum but you can try to post into some house online stores or any online shop on your country. And securing it the best way is to meet up with the buyer.'
p16
aS"If it's just an asset you're trying to get rid of, you should definitely sell for fiat and then convert it in my opinion. You just have a much wider reach when you accept fiat; you don't reach nearly that same amount when you try to only get btc for it. It's possible that you can say that your primary form of payment would be fiat and that a secondary option is bitcoin so that you cover both reaches. Still, I stick with my previous suggestion to contact a real estate agent."
p17
aS'You can describe details your items(house) that need to sale. Including size, location, term, capital, etc.But i think this will got some problems in government regulation about how tax will occur from this transaction.So it would be better, if you selling it by Fiat rather by Bitcoin.'
p18
aS'Yes without any detail of your house, it is impossible to sell it and how people will interest if no detail.First i will suggest to not sell your own property to buy bitcoin. You might loss it. Use your free money to involve in bitcoin.'
p19
aS"I don't think, the government can allow you to do so, as selling the house for bitcoins could bypass seceral taxes which could be noticed by the government and even a strict action could be taken against you. If you are planning to pay all the taxes then surely you have a good idea and any individual holding huge funds in bitcoins would purchase your house."
p20
aS'it\xc2\x92s risky to sell you house for bitcoin you want to use bitcoin as investment???best way to make topic in goods and use social media '
p21
aS'You know what? There are a lot of people that are doing this already, they sell their properties for bitcoin because of the belief that it will be higher in the future.Read all these news: http://mashable.com/2017/11/28/bitcoin-property-selling-australia/#pwsKAmASlPqN\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/5152673/four-bed-essex-house-becomes-first-in-uk-to-be-sold-in-bitcoin/\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/16/first-bitcoin-homes-sell-uk/\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0http://fortune.com/2017/12/12/bitcoin-investors-mortgages/\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0http://www.businessinsider.com/buying-bitcoin-with-mortgages-credit-cards-2017-12'
p22
aS'This would be purchase by person who are near in your location, it is ok to sell your house for bitcoin and i think you already know the risk in crypto currency after you received the payment in terms of bitcoin it would not be stable it has a possibility to decrease or increase its value.But i would suggest that sell your house and receive the payment in fiat and invest only the amlunt of money that you can afford to lose and some amount much better to save it in the bank for other purposes be wise on investing and do not be greedy to earn money that is not good for investors.'
p23
aS'is it your house for living? maybe if it your only one house my advice is dont sell it because its to risky if you sell your house to join in bitcoinor cryptocurrencies\xc2\xa0 trading and maybe the best idea is you can rent your house, and you can use the money to trading in bitcoin '
p24
aS'You dont really sell the house, you exchange the house for bitcoins. Just like you would exchange any other things like cars for a house/flat, because bitcoin is not an official currency you cant really "buy" anything with it.'
p25
aS'For me selling your house for bitcoin is not good idea. But im sure you are selling that for some good reason.Its too risky to do that, so try to find a good buyer, if you find one.But if you are doing these just to invest in bitcoin, try to find a way to earn it. Because again it is too risky.'
p26
aS"Sell your house ! ! !!!! No i think it is not positive to you. In a day you may go different place and can do too many works but at the end of the day you have to come back to your sweet house and\xc2\xa0 you will fill secure and pleasure that you will not get another. you can sell another of your assets like Gold, Car or etc. But don't do this. "
p27
aS"Having a friend or somebody near you who knows about bitcoin and have a lot should be your buyer. Selling it to people who are away can't process the papers and you would have problems on your transactions so this is not possible if you would sell it here. Post on your facebook page or sell it on online sites so you can indicate your place"
p28
aS'I don\xc2\x92t really think so that selling the house and expecting the bitcoins in return is possible right now in any of the country located in this world. The only thing which can help you is that you can sell your house by receiving paper money in return. After getting paper money, you can buy as much number of bitcoins as you want to buy give away that money which you have got from selling of your house.'
p29
aS'I find that not good enough you may not be accepted. Sell \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8byour house for bitcoin so how will you transfer papers and red books? Who will be responsible? If you need money to sell your house and use that money to buy bitcoin is very easy and convenient. Want to sell please contact the real estate.'
p30
aS'before you list the property on the mutiple listing service or anywhere else make sure youve price the home compititvely use the internet to get an idea of selling prices for comporable homes on your nieghborhood and then your house accordingly it easy to get hung up on this step and especialy youve lived in your home for sometimes you may feel compelled to the overprice the home dont fall into the trap remember the goal of this process to sell your home so make sure the asking price is realistic you can also hold an open home to advertise the sell of your home advertise for the open house by posting sign in your neighborhood have some liight refreshment avialable and set out brochures about the home that visitors can take with them as they leave.'
p31
aS"Real life interaction is still needed, the payment will be just for bitcoin but when it comes to papers and proper documentations and transfer, they need to do it personally. Both party will be responsible for doing it not unless someone's going to volunteer to shoulder the expenses (probably the buyer) for those documents that they both need."
p32
aS"Best to do it here on the forum since this is the biggest community of cryptocurrencies and probably some bitcoin millionaire could be interested in your house. Probably post pictures and how much you want for it, so people could assess your property if it is worth buying. Likely though if this is just a normal house, you won't get much interest, since most bitcoin millionaires are flash from what I've seen."
p33
aS"i think this is not the place to discuss this kind of topic better to remove this,If you like to sell house i think selling here is not good post this in social site in your place because most of the crypto user think already a brand new house not a build already sorry to say this but i think selling house here is nonsense.I think mire good to sell gadgets or things that's all i can say."
p34
aS"In fact, selling your house could be perfectly done with cryptocurrency. You would then avoid the middle man and taxes. Just what cryptocurrency stands for. The problem is that you would get your bitcoins to the value of your house today and tomorrow the price of the bitcoins could drop. That's a very big risk you are taking. But probably you believe the price will increase and you will make much more."
p35
aS"Many things can be taken with bitcoins, but it is risky to buy goods that require a license and permission, because in state philosophy everything must be in compliance with laws and require visible evidence. That's why you need another way to pay for your home and car."
p36
aS'\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I think you need to post your house picture and your contact number so that if anyone are interested and want to buy it and pay for bitcoin they can contact you and of course you need to meet the person who wants to buy your house for any paper contract. This is not easy and it is risky i think.'
p37
aS'House is the most basic need and all of us do need shelter for ourselves as well as our family. It is not an easy thing to build a house as things are very much different now. However, if you want to sell your house due to your personal reasons, you need to make sure that you are getting a good amount of money. Selling your house at low prices is of no use. You need to get some handsome amount of money in return.'
p38
aS'That is just the fact. The OP cannot just expect to place some pictures and expect some international dude to pay up for a house over the internet that no one is even sure it may be his. Although it sounds crazy though, while reading through the thread and the OP said he has been trying to sell this house now for over 2 years. I do not know, but unless this is a house in the suburbs, why is it so hard to sell a house in Italy?'
p39
aS'i think this is not the right place to sell your house and no one here will buy your house here.. sell your house for cash to the people and then buy bitcoins from that cash. but have you extra house? if you have only one house dont sell it. put some other money which you have in bank. '
p40
aS"A person that will do that sending bitcoin without personal interaction is just like donating his bitcoin. There's a need for confrontation to make this deal and the thing here is he's going to receive full or portion payment through bitcoin and that's the deal. I don't know the reason what's the reason it is difficult to sell a house in their country. Maybe people there or each individual does have their own house already and doesn't want to add another one."
p41
aS'This is really a very nice thing coming from one of the colleague and must be spread accordingly. House, property, car or agriculture land needs government attestation before purchasing as well as before your have sold it to another person. Bitcoin is in the phase where the governments are silently observing without making any comment, so if you will do any such like activity, anything can happen to you from your government taxation office.'
p42
aS"I think you can use social media to promote your house and sell it. but you only sell it in local area only. because it is risky if you sell it to people you do not know. but it's unfortunate that you sell your house just for bitcoin. bitcoin investment is not always profitable sometimes it will make you lose and lose your money if you use it incorrectly. you should get money not from your home but from your hard work."
p43
aS'That is too much for just an investment that is so risky. Why not just used your house as a business like rental that give you bucks every month that you can used to invest in cryptocurrency. Selling it is not the best thing to do especially if you have family. Think a million times about before doing such move that will turn two ways, good or disastrous.'
p44
aS'You can actually do that but chances on getting it sold directly with bitcoin would really depend on the awareness of bitcoin into your place and on the people who do make use or store on it. If someone would really be interested on using up his bitcoins on buying a house. You can actually do another option which you wont really bother too much on finding those people who would potentially buy your house since you can able to sell it with fiat and do buy bitcoin anytime.'
p45
aS"Really posting the house would be a good one but the truth is that he may not see a serious buyer here unless he is just lucky enough to meet with someone within Italy who is rich enough to make such a deal or an international person who likes buying property and no one will obviously want to make such a deal online or would not want to be too careful getting the wrong papers for a house that is not even the OP's own.The best is just to find a real estate agent and see where that leads him."
p46
aS'Now-a-days, there are number of online websites which are really helping number of people in buying and selling things like houses and cars etc. this will actually help you in having a good money and that too without having so much hard work to do. All you need to do is to put an advertisement along with the pictures of the house and the demand, you will get the customers of your choice.'
p47
aS'safest way is to make a deed of sale and state there the price of your sold house in order to make the sale legally binding for both of you and the buyer. the price i believe must be in terms of your local currency.'
p48
aS'I know, in marketing way there is no problem with it and I think it can be sold right away if he want to. But in my opinion if you have to sell you must have an alternative home to stay or with your family. It isn\xc2\x92t practical to sell your house and renting another after because that is not a wise thinking. So he better have 2 or more house to do this, if he don\xc2\x92t have then it won\xc2\x92t be a good decision.'
p49
aS"I dont think there are people here that are interested with that offer i think you can make deal with locals their that has some interest in bitcoin or just try posting here some images of your house, rooms, design, how is it built if its 2 storey, who knows some might get interested here. Or just contact a real estate dealer but really this is some bizarre decision but anyways a real estate agent should help you with this although i've heard people selling their houses for btc. I think you will get fiat in exchange for your house then you can buy btc with using your fiat currency."
p50
aS'OP should just sell it in their local and not here because no one will be serious here and he might get fool here and besides no one will be gets interested in just seeing just the pictures so better if they have a ocular visit.Yeah better to post and find a buyer in your local and sell your house hassle free.'
p51
aS'Hmm. That looks like one secluded part of Italy. Never been there before but at least the post satisfied the curiosity. However, trying to find a buyer here may not work, and the location too though, maybe that is the reason you have not really seen a buyer. I wish you find an international buyer but we both know that would be hard considering a lot.Why not OP find some agents in their place that can make use that of in Italy ? No one can give them the best and secure way to do this and if they are looking at selling their house to someone in Italy on this forum, it is better to make use of an escrow, but that is some big stuff though and I really do not know how escrow is going to work.'
p52
aS'make some ads in Chinese websites many of them works as miners and have many bitcoins to use it.also who have illegal works may pay for you. '
p53
aS'this is the wrong place for you to market your home this is only place to invest for you. and this can only be known by the traders only, but if these traders are interested you can send your building form of the form of room, shape of the living room, and the location of your home yard. and you can also market through facebok, twiter and other online sites ....'

p4
aS"It is true that Bitcoin is more used as investment and less used as digital currency that it should be, because its price grow fast. I also think that the reason why merchants and big online sellers do not accept Bitcoin is because it is unstable to be used as medium of exchange and transaction fees are really expensive to make small transactions. But I believe that in future they will consider it, if the problem in Bitcoin network have solved. Personally I haven't used my Bitcoin to buy some products but I can use it to pay my monthly bills such as utility bills with the help of local exchange."
p5
aS"I bought so many digital goods by directly paying with bitcoin. And for buying from other online shops I used bitcoin debit card, once I did lots of shopping.But now I have almost stopped spending bitcoins due to its high transaction fee, sometimes I feel bad for not able to spend accordingly as per my needs.Today it seems the transaction fee is very low compared with other days ($1.12)....Bitcoin is now suitable for big transactions and for investment purposes only as you said. But for daily transaction (small), it is not reasonable.In this case LN maybe helpful, though I'm not sure completely. "

I would like to buy more stuff with Bitcoins, but I would need to buy it from foreign countries and calculating the costs of the product + fees + the risk of not receiving the package, it's a bit frustrating...Seems I will have to wait more retailers in my country adopt Bitcoin and start accepting it as payment to use the currency to go shopping.Depending the country where you are it's not a problem, there are many people enjoying a lot to use their BTCs to buy products, what is amazing, but when there isn't confidence between the customers and the post office company, the hostile modus operandi overcomes."

I later contacted their customer care, \xc2\xa0and they claimed that I must have gott the airtime, \xc2\xa0which I never did. I had no other choice than to forget about it.Honestly I am not discouraging anyone for not trying. But I suggest to double confirm before trying out. Because, fiat is working in different way from bitcoin is working. Even bitcoin transactions are visible to anyone, some customer executives are not understanding that which may lead to unnecessary problems.'

p24
aS'I used Bitcoin many times to buy services and some goods online, it is mainly a crypto currency, so it is normal that we use it to buy and sell products online.

p3
aS"Stick with your plan and what you believe that bitcoin will increase on 2018. I myself is a long term holder and I don't care even there are too many crashes or corrections are happening. There's no loss if you are moving forward and viewing your future plan while executing it. But if you are only looking for day to day profits or even a week or month, there's a loss behind it. Keep on buying now as it's about to rise."
p4
aS"Actually I also analyzed it and observed the previous months ago since price has not reached above $10k, it was just the same pattern happening now. After all pumps of price, the scenario kepts changing and changing anytime. And as we're far more of its value compared from 2 months passed away, I guess that the price will really have to stabilize in order to achieve corrections or somewhat they called a bubble price. "
p5
aS'Now is good time while price is down. Network is overloaded at the moment, looks like spam attack, lots of fud are here, i think roger ver is spreading fud all over the forum but as i got used to it already i think price will increase in upcoming months.'

I think it is the high time to buy bitcoin.Now it's price is $14,406.3799.It's much less than the highest price.We are hoping that the price will again rise in the coming year of 2018.Then you must get a profit.So,if anyone willing to buy bircoin,I think,he can hardly get the oppurtunity like this week."
p9
aS'At this price rate yes!!!,its a pure chance to buy right now and earn more in the coming 2018,this price drop is just a dip and will wake up again after the recent fork will be distributed i think like what happned when b2x where issued.'

p18
aS"I think it'll be a good idea at the moment when Bitcoin price is really low, around 13k$. Beside as I know there is a hard fork coming so you'll get free coin if you buy Bitcoin at the moment and keep it after the hard fork .\xc2\xa0 "
p19
aS'Bitcoin has a tendency to hit its peak near the end of year. It is possible we\'ve already seen the high and won\'t reach a new high until near the end of 2018. The introduction of bitcoin futures and coinbase support for bitcoin cash has definitey changed trading patterns and price movements, which needs to be taken into consideration. Volatility and the size of price swings is also much higher.Buying at a relatively low price, say $12k at the moment, could be an "ok" strategy over the short term. The increasingly speculative nature of bitcoin may have detracted from its historical role of being a store of long term value.'
p20
aS'\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I think it is good to buy bitcoin now because this coming 2018 i think bitcoin price will increase again . If you buy now that was a good strategy to make a lot of profit and income if the bitcoin price goes up this coming year.'

aS'if you want to buy bitcoin, now is the best time to buy it, because right now the price of bitcoin is in the low, its mean that you can buy it and hold it until the price if that bitcoin is getting high again, so when the price of bitcoin is rising up i think you can get some profit from it'
p22
aS'First of all provide the amount of money that you can afford to lose, then look on the bitcoin price chart if you see that bitcoin value is dropping down much better to buy bitcoin because after the dump the value will increase soon. And i advise dont do any panic selling after you have bitcoin just hold it for long period of time because i know it will generate good amount of profit.'

p39
aS'Its better to move now than later,because this is the best time to buy BTC due to fluctuation from 19KUSD went down to 14KUSD and i believe that will come up again by early 2018.'
p40
aS"You should definitely buy as soon as you can. Bitcoin has been on the verge of a strong rise once again, and I doubt we'll be seeing sub 13000 in the next few days again. If you do have the opening on that price window, make sure you take it asap. If you're looking to purchase, just go for it now and don't think twice. If you get scared somewhere in the middle, just hold and tell yourself that you'll sell when you see the profit window open. Many people bought at around 18k and ended up selling at 13k. Bitcoin is currently sitting at 15.5k. That's an extra 2,500 USD that they missed out on."

We may not know right? I\'ve been here in the crypto industry a little bit long to tell you that the bitcoin has very high chance that it will increase it\'s value again but i also see how the bitcoins price go lower and lower.'
p43
aS'The current market price is little low as compared to that of the market price of bitcoin a week ago. If you are going to buy some bitcoins, then do it as early as possible. At the very present moment, buying of bitcoins will be highly economical as you will be able to buy more number of bitcoins in less price. Moreover, you will also be able to make more profit by investing in bitcoins right now.'
p44
aS"I'll buy some bitcoin if the bitcoin price drops even I'll buy a lot of bitcoin, I'm not afraid of losing because I'm sure bitcoin prices will go up and I can sell it again when bitcoin prices go up as I expect. .

aS'To my opinion, it s always risky when it comes to investment, however, bitcoin is still rising and is gonna keep up rising no matter the fluctuations and frankly its gonna reach a price that s gonna surprise everybody. You always wanna telling yourself its not gonna rise but in the end, we all know how its gonna end up. Its still time to get some of them.\xc2\xa0'

I don't know is it will go down or go up."
p56
aS'If the price so much lower then now good time to buy. Buy lower and sell high is basic way how to trade in cryptocurrency. Most people think the price will grow next year so thats why many people hold it.'

Best option for this is a hardware wallet (ex: Nano Ledger S or similar devices) as they are safe even if connecting it to a PC infected by a malware, as your private key never leaves the device. The worst option would be to keep your BTC in exchange wallets, as they are the main targets for the hackers.If you enjoy trading, you could only buy BTC for ~60-70% of your budget, and invest the rest of it in Altcoins with strong projects behind. (Waves, Verge, Siacoin, Tron etc)'

aS'Yeah, I have also noticed that Bitcoin is kind of running back up. Those that bought at $15000 seems to be quite lucky, though I\xc2\x92ve always believed that the price decrease was due to the holiday. The increase was not even only in Bitcoin, Ethereum is now $1000. So investing right now might be the best thing to do, cause it might go very high after now.'
p86
aS"To date, there has been a new sinking of Bitcoin. Maybe For those users who believe in Bitcoin's active growth in the future, today is the day when you can make a purchase of Bitcoin cheaper. How will you make an investment in the future, which I will bring you a huge profit."
p87
aS'At present, when the Bitcoin rate is low, it is advisable if you have money to invest in Bitcoin, or you can refer to the top 10 altcoins and invest if you want. But in my personal opinion, you should invest in altcoin will have the opportunity to earn huge profits because in 2018 the altcoin specifically Ethereum will have a breakthrough growth! Expected to exceed $ 10,000 by the end of 2018'
p88
aS"Good thing OP's thought didn't materialized yet as we can seen from latest prices of bitcoin it's actually getting a hard time to pump, this could be a good potential for alts holders\xc2\xa0 "
p89
aS'buy some cheap coins. stay afloat until the price exceeds the expectation'
p90
aS"Buy buy.. this is the right time to buy before it would be moving up again, or you can changed the investment into focusing more in altcoins, especially in Ethereum. Bitcoin seems looks like it's getting astray right now, it's has been a few days, its movement looks stuck to going up to reach a higher price. I think it's need a long time to reach a higher price, but if you a strong holders.. it's doesn't matter."
p91
aS"For me, buying Bitcoin at any time is a smart investment. Because investing in bitcoins is safest for your capital and it also gives you huge profits. Bitcoin is taking a whale's push to create a new peak, which is being squeezed so that impatient people will sell bitcoins during this time and the whales will buy it all away. Be wise in your investment decision, which has a huge impact on your assets."
p92
aS"Panic buying make's you become worst and you will blame your self and if you cannot handle it you will regret,the right time to buy bitcoin is when the price is dump that is the right time to buy cheap bitcoin and hold it or use it in a investment,and investing in bitcoin is the best way to earn huge profit but it is very risky be wise and make a good strategy\xc2\xa0 to become successful and to earn huge profit,and long term holding is the easy way to earn high profit even it takes a long time because bitcoin price goes higher and higher and if you reach your target sell it and you will earn more profit."
p93
aS'I really love how cointelegraph reviews the possibilities of the bitcoin future price. check it out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRjzkv4tMFgbeen watching their vids non stop '
p94
aS"Don't think twice on buying bitcoin now, because bitcoin is not going down, It's rising up every year even now 2018 it is not to late to buy it, and focus only in bitcoin, if it rise up just wait don't sell or trade just wait and wait it will never stop rising and one you just noticed you are a millionaire already."
p95
aS'I think this is a good idea, now I can accept the price of the currency, I think in the future, the price of the currency will break through high, reaching a very high level, at that time, we will get very high returns'
p96
aS'If you are actually planning of buying some bitcoins, then you need to hurry up. It is because of the reason that the market value of bitcoin is little low at the very present time and this is like the golden opportunity for you. You actually need to cash this opportunity so that you can have more profit at the time when the market price of bitcoin will start rising up. Bitcoin is no doubt one of the best investments.'
p97
aS'I think everything about buying bitcoin depends on your plans or set goals, like investing or holding the coin. It is better to make quick decision now and buy because the price may pump up above the money you currently have and you may regret it tomorrow. I also think that you are buying at the right time.'
p98

p99
aS'You can buy some bitcoins now.. Because the price is now\xc2\xa0 little bit stable.. And it will cross 25k $ in few months later.. You can hold some altcoins also for long term.. '
p100
aS'For me this is the great time to buy bitcoin because bitcoin now is very low value price so if you have\xc2\xa0 a plan now you choose bitcoin to buy because if the bitcoin will rice again im sure your profit will be double in the day if bitcoin will rise again.we know the movement of bitcoin is pumping and dumping so you think it in your mind bitcoin it needed a patience if you like to get a good profit.'
p101
aS'Buy bitcoin now the price is cheaper compare to the high price set on 4rt quarter, great you have this plan but be mindful about the possibility that it will continue down this month to be sure use technical indicator to properly decide before entering trade'
p102
aS"Yes deifinitely a good idea buy some bitcoin while the price is low it will give you double or triple profit If the price of bitcoin increase. we all not that Bitcoin is not a stable value that is a risky part of investing in bitcoin. we just need patience and don't panic if the price is falling. Also try to buy some altcoins too. "
p103
aS'Its a great opportunity now to kiss the moon. If i only have a money to invest i would buy as many as i can. I will hold it for months until end of the year maybe the price will boom again like last year. Bitcoin will rise again just avoid listening to some fraudsters news always fake.'
p104
aS'To buy bitcoin is very good for profit.If you stock it for long term,so it will be very profitable for you.It is true that some times the price of bitcoins fluctuates ,but for a long term holder it is truely profitable.Because the price of this cryptocurrency in increasing day by day.'
p105
aS'Don\xc2\x92t you guys think that the price hasn\xc2\x92t reached its lowest yet? I\xc2\x92ve been hearing from my friends that the price for Bitcoin might drop as low as $4000 or even go below that. I don\xc2\x92t know if that is true, and today, I also came across a news that said same thing, and later when I logged in on Bitcointalk, I also saw someone repeat the same thing. Maybe I will wait for a while before making any move, just to be very sure about that.'
p106
aS'Exactly! At the very present time, if there is some investment which is considered to be the best investment in the world, then that is none other than that of investing your money into bitcoin and buying of some good number of bitcoins. This is actually a very good decision of buying of bitcoins and that it will for sure help you in making lot of money which you will then be using to have a dream life.'
p107
aS'it a good idea to buy bitcoin today and because there is a huge potential that bitcoin price will rise up this year but we cant say when because as of now bitcoin is going up and down so we cant say but if it started to up again that is the good thing.'
p108
aS'Yes buy and buy, now that its price is getting low, the lower the price the more btc you can buy and the more btc you buy the more profit you will earn if its price goes up.Bitcoin is the number one cryptocurrency, so it is very posible that its price will increase again to the point that it will surpass its higher price record.For now lets trust it, be patient all the time.'
p109
aS'It is still a good timing to buy bitcoin right now actually. From 14k$ now the value of bitcoin was 10k$ almost if I am not mistaken. So lets us take the chance to buy it then hold in for 6 months depending on what months or how long will you hold it. '
p110
aS"if you want to buy coins for a while, it's time to buy, because in the markets all the new coins have decreased, I also recently bought eth, and ltc, hopefully this coin that I bought this coin is rapidly increasing and high selling value, because I still newbi, just based on perasaab just buy some coins"
p111
aS"Buy at yesterday's low price. Buy and hold it, do not sell it when it's down. Be calm. I think Bitcoin will be of high value in the future!"
p112
aS"I hope you bought yesterday, with so much huge price drops that's the opportunity all traders are waiting\xc2\xa0 always look for dump prices before you buy, i believe you are cautious dude judging on your words."
p113
aS'In my opinion the price will go up again in the very last week of the this year. If you want to buy bitcoin it is the right time because the price is quite low and as the new year\xc2\xa0 the price will jump like kangaroo and till the end of this year 2018 the price will be more than 30k. Therefore you should buy bitcoin today without wasting time. You may not be able to find such a great chance of buying bitcoin in low price. Go ahead and invest in bitcoin. '
p114
aS'it will increase for sure but in crypto world all is different but amazing at the same time'
p115
aS"10k or 15k doesn't matter that much if you're in for the long run. It's still a good time to buy although I think it's definitely better to invest in alts these days. There are many rock solid coins which are fairly likely to increase in value more than btc will. Btc is still the best way to go if you want to be extra safe and the same can be said for Eth"
p116
aS"Well thought, If you are able to buy a Bitcoin then it would be a good investment for the future purpose. Day by day the popularity of Bitcoin is getting higher, people are becoming involved in this platform day by day.so that it will be a great asset to you when you get a Bitcoin. Not only that but also Bitcoin would be useful in your daily life. that's why it must be a good investment for you."
p117
aS'No doubt that it is a good time to buy bitcoin, because in current time the price of bitcoin is trading in a low price and i cannot see any specially reason for the price to dump more, i think that the investors are now taking benefit from the opportunity and they will surely buy bitcoin in such a low price and therefore there are more chances that the price will at once start increasing and i am sure that in this rally we will see the price of bitcoin crossing 30000$. Therefore we should also try to get benefit from this opportunity and should buy bitcoin in time. '
p118
aS'Definitely! Now is one of the better time to buy Bitcoin.\xc2\xa0 The dip simply tells us that we can get bitcoin at a cheaper price.\xc2\xa0 And I believe that the current state of Bitcoin will definitely change.\xc2\xa0 Right after devs release the new update, I believe bitcoin price will start to skyrocket since the upcoming update will be the solution to scalability problem and long confirmation .\xc2\xa0 This update is the long awaited by the community.'
p119
aS'\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes,it is good to buy bitcoin while it is low price now because i believe one day bitcoin will rise rapidly like a rocket. The decreasing of bitcoin last week is just a sign that it will increase more like the year 2017.'
p120
aS'Well I hope you made the best decision you can for yourself.....\xc2\xa0 This for me are the best times to invest in bitcoin....\xc2\xa0 Cheers to your success '
p121
aS"As of now the price of the bitcoin is a 11,200 and that price still very high even the price decreased brcause the price last few years is very low.\xc2\xa0 For sure most of the people have plan to buy again bitcoin . Don't mis this opportunity to buy bitcoin because for sure once the ruce increase again it will continue and we will see the price very high and that's goos to us who have bitcoin in their wallet.\xc2\xa0 Don't wait the price to decrease more because anytime the price will increase.\xc2\xa0 But invest only you can afford to lose brcause they have possible the price will decrease more so if you have extra money you can buy more bitcoin. "
p122
aS'I believe it will remain stable until 2018 and will rise again around 20k shortly\xc2\xa0  '
p123
aS'we must understand that investing in crypto currency or in general trading on the exchange is akin to gambling. I think that many users should understand the risks that everyone is exposed when they try to buy or sell Bitcoin.'
p124
aS'Your funny. You should know first how volatile bitcoin is and that confidence that saying that there is no loss is how most newbies think and those are the types that quickly sell their holdings in these bearish cycles. Change your mindset first before you buy or if you buy again.'
p125
aS'Wow this is really good news because now it is chance for those how are investing right now. In future everyone know s price of bitcoin will increase 12k is not very high price because in previous year price of bitcoin was very high even people were saying that it will not get down and they were not able to buy but now it is golden chance to buy bitcoin and save it for long time. Selling bitcoin till it goes high is best and it is beneficial for all kind of investors.'
p126
aS'you are wrong, bitcoin in every early year always like this, and also with so many event hardfork and others event. soon, the price will recovery or even reach a new ATH. every year bitcoin always and surely always survive, even in this year. so easy for bitcoin to reach new ATH '
p127
aS"Now bitcoin price is low so you can buy it in this time. Actually personally i want to say that it's very difficult that it's price will not increase or decrease. But i hope it's price will increase so you can buy it."
p128
aS'Now its a perfect moment to buy bro!!! 8k.... thats incredible! will be in 12k in next days.. will see'
p129
aS'When can that be? No one can speculate accurately the value of bitcoin in the coming days. As for op, this is the right time to buy bitcoins if you want to invest your money. The price is stable for a few days and now even getting lower. If the value recover again, you can make good profit. '
p130
aS"risk is always better way to get the level of life some people are thinking this is not the time to buy it want to tell them if they are connected with btc they should know previous statement of btc what btc had done with the people\xc2\xa0 (isn't true ?) they should check the previous chart of btc market and then talk o this matter we should think about just now btc going lower now so we can buy it other wise btc will can increase any time i am gonna invest. "
p131
aS'Buy these days! its the moment now, 8.000/ BTC...'
p132
aS'When to buy some bitcoin?..We never know when is the best time to buy bitcoin. Always remember when you enter into this kind of transactions theres always a risk. Bitcoin is very volatile. Study the chart of bitcoin when the period bitcoin drops down maybe this will give you a hint.n'
p133
aS"Trade using Paxful.com They're the best when it comes to trading"
p134
aS'good decision bro... this is the time to buy some bitcoins. it is now fucking dip. probably next pump will reach the 25K'
p135
aS'Have you put your trust in bitcoin? That means you accept the uncertain market of bitcoin. That is necessary. Nobody here can give you the best time to buy bitcoin. Take a look at your investment and business strategy with bitcoin. Compared to a few months ago, I think price bitcoin is now appropriate to invest in it.'
p136
aS'The best time to buy bitcoin was in 2009.The second best time is NOW! Make the most of the drops while you can before the rates go back up to normal!'
p137
aS"IF you're still up for the Bitcoin buying, around now should be the best time to buy, tho you could still wait a little while longer, because with the controversy going on about it, I see it dipping even to the point of 7000$, that will be the lowest i feel it would go before things stabilize again . But if you have already gotten your coin, just HODL through this rough times, it only gets better."
p138
aS'now here is a good chance to buy some bitcoin because the price is going down, and my advice is better not to keep it in the long run because the price stability is hard to guess.'
p139
aS"Now is the right time to buy bitcoin because it still going down right now. You should think twice if want to buy because it's to risky you maybe loose or but double.Moreover if want to buy bitcoin observe first if the price is going crack down or dump up."
p140
a.(lp0
S"Here's why I think $6 trillion is completely reasonable:1. Wall Street hasn't jumped in yet. 2. Big business still has its toes in the water. 3. There's widespread and mainstream awareness,\xc2\xa0 but very little mainstream adoption. 4. We're going to see at least one governments currency collapse soon, with that nation switching to cryptos. That will begin a widespread acceptance of cryptos as legitimate.5. The trend in the general population is anti central authority aka. big banks, governments, big corporations. Look at brexit, Trump, the rise of nationalism against the EU, etc.\xc2\xa0 Cryptocurrencies are the embodiment of anti authority and giving the people more control over their wealth. With so many catalysts, a 10-12x growth for this market is definitely a possibility.What do you all think?----@charteroakpublic - a Telegram channel dedicated to providing leaks from premium sources like Palm Beach Confidential and more."
p1
aS'I think your last two points are wrong, your fourth point is something we all know the current system is unsustainable, however the market is not rational if it was all the economy should have collapsed already so I do not know if we are going to see any collapse soon, and your fifth point is mistaken as well, centralization is all over the place but people do not see it, people use Facebook, Google and many other apps that have accesa to all their information and governments are becoming more centralized as well, so I do not see a decentralization trend at all.'
p2
aS'Yes and no.Yes, because the cryptocurrency market is indeed potentially worth that much. It could grow even higher than that. Prices have indeed grown by already more than x10 the past year (2017), so that is something to consider although since indeed there is not even 10% of the population that actually buys and uses crypto, there is indeed a lot of room for growth.No, because wall street just follows where the money is at. That is not something sustainable. Let\'s all remember these are the guys that brought us the financial crisis years back. It\'s not like they are ethical enough to even prevent that from happening again. But let\'s do hope the new policies and laws around the world would prevent another financial crisis with cryptocurrencies being the "catalyst" for that event.'
p3
aS'Given the factor that only a small percentage of people knows cryptomarket, there is really a huge chance that it will grow to what OP is thinking, and further more, I believe it will even surpass this market capitalization.\xc2\xa0 Once country are able to regulate cryptocurrency and had adjusted its banking sytem / finance system to the trend of cryptocurrency, they will adopt it one by one thus creating more market for cryptocurrency.\xc2\xa0 with this factor alone (government accepting and regulating cryptocurrency) will definitely boost the market cap though, I am a bit hesitant if it will happen this 2019.'
p4
aS"I agree with 2, 3 and don't want to comment something I agree on. I don't agree on 1 because you don't know that. I am pretty sure wall street has jumped in. I don't agree with 4 either, local authorities won't let it happen. 5 - look how many people have invested in ripple. Take a look at exchange regulation. Anti central authority my ass, things you mentioned have nothing to do with crypto, it is politic. "
p5
aS'there is one thing that I think is impossible and unreasonable. the state will not let its currency be destroyed. because this we can see that the currency can be said as a symbol of a country. if the country does not have its own currency, the country will become weak economy and the state bank is unlikely to let this happen'
p6
aS"You actually have some good point there and its something we can relate with but at the same time all of those things are happenings that are normal in the economic development of the world and a lot of things there can equally happen but rather than increasing the price of market capitalization, it could mean the end of bitcoin One, when wall street enters the market as you have predicted, they come in with huge money which then give them some reasonable control which make the drive price to the direction they so wish. They can drive it to the point where they pull out and won't go up again. Stock market crash of 2008 is a lesson for all.Again on your number 4 about seeing a currency crash which then means that bitcoin is the alternative, I guess that is thinking gone too far. Several years Greece battle with debt they didn't switch to bitcoin, Zimbabwe had the same issues but that didn't make them to switch it means there are several ways to solve a problem than one way you are looking at it."
p7
aS"I'll try to add a few points.6. According to polls, only 2% of americans have used bitcoin or a crypto currency. There is plenty of room for growth.7. There was a statistic issued awhile ago where it was claimed the number of bitcoin users doubles every 12 months or so. It could be a developing metric similar to Moore's Law.8. A stat was released earlier this year claiming coinbase has around 100,000 new sign ups per day which could indicate that crypto's userbase is constantly growing at a decent clip.(If you want I can get you sources for all those points, although they should be easy to find via search engine)"
p8
aS"They have jumped in already to spread lies and FUD about bitcoin. But there must be a personal interest on why they are doing that and one thing I guess, it's to buy at dip.I agree on this, bigger businesses haven't entered yet although there are some that are already in.Publicity whether it's good or bad it's still publicity so this awareness is nowhere to go but to full adoption.I'm not sure about this, a government will not allow something decentralize to take over their currency.Not in general.These are only few things but there's more to come and I do believe that $6T in crypto market is peanuts."
p9
aS'I dont think so,i am expecting 2-3$ trillion market at max by the end.it is true that majority of tycoon and stock trader are seeing crypto more profitable and tax free asset that other assets.but still only few government has taken initiative to legalise crypto so we have to see what comes next.'
p10
aS"Well not bad idea some corporations are starting to jump into crypto space. And yes we are still on a early stages of this industry Crypto world offers new and great technologies that other industries doesn't have. Once the mass adoption starts we can easily a spike in the total market capitalization but i don't agree to fully kick the paper money system and governments or else they will do everything to stop the crypto. I think it's much better if cryptocurrencies will be just an option."
p11
aS"Fine, but you only discussed the pros, it is hard to make predictions if you don't also consider the cons..."
p12
aS"It definitely has the potential to reach that number and even higher if everything goes well, hint hint: Lightning network.But we also need to consider the things which aren't doing very well at the moment,The fees per transaction are similar to what wire transfer charges are.Transfer takes few hours when it was supposed to be instant.Complicated process to achieve crypto-currency and not suitable for non tech guys.Lastly, unstable prices is good sign but only as long as it keeps increasing on regular basis.Very frequent falls might prevent every day big businesses from using it."
p13
aS'People blame wall street for the economic crisis and the housing bubble but lets be frank a crisis of that size cannot happen just because the bankers were greedy it was the fault of all society, the governments kept the interest rates too low this created cheap credit and everyone was spending more than what they afford, banks gave credit to almost anyone that is true, but people were dumb enough to sign the papers thinking they could somehow afford a house.'
p14
aS"This. To be honest everyone already is aware of Bitcoin. They just don't care what it is,why does it exist, and how is it going to benefit us as a consumer in the market. There are many countries with few people that adopted Bitcoin already and they will make an effort in getting everyone's attention into it on how great could it contribute in the future of finances. The only thing that nullifies this are the regulation and banning of Bitcoin in a specified country. Regulation could be great because government could help promote the Bitcoin in other countries but expect taxes that might cause reduction to investors. Banning is what makes it worst for people to adopt. Only the interested one will do everything to learn Bitcoin even if banning was done in that country although there aren't that many people that will try that because of fear of law. It is quite fascinating that it reaches the media though, it could help the Bitcoin a bit to spread out adoption around the world.It is gonna be a war, trust me. Cryptocurrencies especially Bitcoin is really decentralized and government will try to take over it by being the one to dictate the price. Investors need to fight even harder to make the government currency collapse soon or prove its legitimacy to the public so we can gain a lot of investors that will believe in cryptos and everyone will follow. Right now, government is stating to put regulation in cryptocurrencies. It is always the time to prove the cryptos are powerful for the future."
p15
aS"Not sure about that, it does seem like parts of Wall Street already have skin in the game. However institutional investors are still missing. I don't expect them to enter the market until the market cap and price stability has increased though. Once they're in we would have a pretty solid price base.Fully agreed.I don't see this happening anytime soon. Government currency collapse maybe, but I think an official switch to cryptos is rather unlikely. I could see unofficial use of cryptocurrencies by the general populace though, however not until transaction fees have been curbed by improved scalability.Voting for Trump to fight the establishment is like buying into Ripple as a cryptocurrency. It may seem like a good idea to some, but is ultimately a misled approach at solving a misunderstood problem.Personal convictions aside, I see very little anti authoritarian and decentralized thinking in the world. Otherwise people would actually move away from all the central authorities that dominate their lifes instead of complaining about politics by posting on Facebook from their iPhones that they paid for with their VISA when they bought it from Amazon. If anything the rise of nationalism has shown that the world has become more conservative and protectionist. "
p16
aS"Op's number (4) seem like an item that will lead to a financial revolution if it happens especially to the international currencies, for instance dollar. Otherwise , some fiat have already collapsed for long and dont worth much."
p17
aS"It habitually happens that government's currency collapses, so that is nothing new and special. But do you think they will use the independent and decentralized already available crypto currencies or do you think they will introduce their own one? I think they will introduce their own one, but it will surely lead to more awareness about crypto currencies in general."
p18
aS'There are many so called "experts" who come to cryptocurrency and blockchain who make a fool of themselves. Not saying that Rabblerah112 is one of them, but you have to question all these newbs coming in here and opens a thread telling everyone what he "thinks", which in Rabblerah112\'s post looks like it was copied somewhere.'
p19
aS"i generally tend not to listen to experts' on crypto. more optimistic of the developer team. "
p20
aS"We need this modern digital money in life that's why the price will be high in the future because the knowledge about it is we need and we can earn also at the same time so this will be popular all around the world in the future,i think the price of it if this will continue are going really high soon but we can't predict that because it's so hard to speculate this."
p21
aS"wall street jumping in doesn't mean it will go up, they could bet it going down as well.it's already a given that cryptocurrency is an investment vehicle, not a currency. it's far easier to use cash/credit cards for everyday transaction."
p22
aS'Seriously, we expect that to happen in just these few months. We are all eyeing on wall street big boys who may bring some big money into Bitcoin. I do believe that bitcoin will reach high rate and a high level that too on very soon. All we need right now must be, bitcoin needs to break $20k price levels after that we can see the entire crypto world will be testing some unbelievable market cap like in trillions. There are almost 23 more months for 2019 to be completed. I guess this will be plenty of time in which we can expect even 10 trillion dollars market cap too. '
p23
aS'wall street goes both ways. some big boys will be buying bitcoin, however there will also be big boys believing bitcoin is nothing more than a fad/tulip and shorting it.'
p24
aS'\xc2\xa0As we had observed now a days,more crypto currencies had shown its capability and had reached to the moon. Its growth really amazing will surely can boost the crypto market even more than $6 trillion by 2019.'
p25
aS'With every passing day, the graph of the people who are getting to know about the crypto currencies and the ones who are investing their money into crypto market is increasing very much significantly. Till the time, more people will keep on investing their money into this market, the worth of the crypto market will keep on increasing and there are chances that it will reach to this much value by the end of next year.'
p26
aS"#2 & #3 For sure!!!\xc2\xa0 Still a lot of room, $6 trillion isn't out of the question!"
p27
aS'It will be a sort of revolution between the people and the government in coming time as few govt this year has already hinted that they do not support such cypto currency and people on other hand would like to own it and make it one of the option for them self for their investment or in their daily life by working full time in it. If other government do start banning it then the number will go down rather than rising.'
p28
aS"I am more interested to know how did you get to the number of 6T$?I mean, it's a very specific number, so I guess you probably did kind of calculation.Anyway, I believe that bitcoin won't grow so much, as 6T$ put the whole crypto market to be close to the Gold market cap- industry that are being supported worldwide and has a history of being a store of value.I think that 2018 is going to be the test year for crypto currencies, as regulators are going to enter the free market and are probably going to try and stop the cryptocurrencies exchanges.It would be interesting to know how we can deal with regulators. "
p29
aS"I assume that he only estimated it. He has given his points on those things that aren't happening in the world of crypto's and that will be a big impact if those points will start to get working with cryptos.Mainstream is one of the noisiest help that crypto can get from publishing and raising awareness that crypto's are real. But it will be also the reason behind those FUDs, mainstream medias keeps on interviewing wrong people giving their wrong views."
p30
aS'When major industrialized countries have entered,I think that there is no winning of non-centralized settlement currencies.'
p31
aS"I think this is a pretty optimistic viewpoint overall. I don't think that in the next year or two that an entire government's currency is going to collapse AND that their new currency is going to be a crypto currency.1) Crypto requires technology, and a country that has their currency fail is probably not going to have ample technology to support a crypto currency and make their entire population to use it.2) I don't think a majority is anti-centralization. I think a majority don't even know the difference between centralized and decentralized organizations. Even then, capitalism is pretty dominant all around and that requires some centralization."

aS'Even if the countries do not involve themselves in the trading but allow their industrialists to do the trades in cryptocurrency, then the target can be achieved.

p35

And when it will increase, this will continue to grow until 2019 of what we are expecting.'

aS'Seriously, we expect that to happen in just these few months. We are all eyeing on wall street big boys who may bring some big money into Bitcoin. I do believe that bitcoin will reach high rate and a high level that too on very soon. All we need right now must be, bitcoin needs to break $20k price levels after that we can see the entire crypto world will be testing some unbelievable market cap like in trillions. There are almost 23 more months for 2019 to be completed. I guess this will be plenty of time in which we can expect even 10 trillion dollars market cap too. '

If other government do start banning it then the number will go down rather than rising.'
p46
aS"I am more interested to know how did you get to the number of 6T$?I mean, it's a very specific number, so I guess you probably did kind of calculation.Anyway, I believe that bitcoin won't grow so much, as 6T$ put the whole crypto market to be close to the Gold market cap- industry that are being supported worldwide and has a history of being a store of value.I think that 2018 is going to be the test year for crypto currencies, as regulators are going to enter the free market and are probably going to try and stop the cryptocurrencies exchanges.It would be interesting to know how we can deal with regulators.

S"I hope everybody would be fair about this new feature implemented by admin theymos. This thread is for the purpose of awareness that merit is given to a constructive and quality post. I have made a thread here in the market place section, hoping that there will not be such things like buying and selling merits. Let's work with our own asses. P.S. OP\xc2\xa0 is not asking attention, read and understand.\xc2\xa0 Obedience is better than sacrifice."
p1
aS"Saddly, but many people are already selling/buying Merit points, for example here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2827197.0On local boards there are much more Merit sellers. There was people who got 20 or even 50 Merit for a low quality posts, it's obvious abuse of Merit system. Both, buyer and seller has to be reported to DT members and they will give them red trust rating."
p2
aS"I still hope for the best, but, based on your given link, he sells but there is no buyer, and don't worry about that account, it has red flags, a proof that he is not trust worthy and if ever somebody get into that it will be easily trace. And DT MEMBERS will take action to that. "
p3
aS'Perhaps many buy and sell merit points in secret, I think it is very difficult to get merit points, most people will probably take a shortcut, maybe they have multiple accounts to send each other..'
p4
aS'merit for me is important matter because merit is our evalution to bitcoin...it will show of our performance how to be cooperative and patient to all we posting...we must learn and give value to merit that we have and do not sale for it,,,we keep it...its shown our deducated to our work,'
p5
aS'this system is new and most of the merits goes to meta posts.people need more time to know about this system. maybe 1-3 months is enough time to know if this system good or bad.we have total 600,000 smerits and 36 sources. let\xc2\x92s wait more time and Then we judge the system'
p6
aS'I do not know who are selling smerits, But seen some of the DT members are exchanging the smerit each other as they have good rapport each other in the multiple projects. Funniest side they gave the merits for yes or no answer too.I do not know how admin takes this. Implementation of merit score is good according to me. There is no higher and smaller guys to say the post quality is this or that. Let have the best quality in out show posts page. All will rid-off.'
p7
aS"They will be exposed soon in no time.There's no shortcut to success so if they will do it then they will be known and probably be tagged by DT's. That's a desperate one, everyone is aware that merits are not for sale and it shouldn't be bought."
p8
aS'I stopped posting on reddit after a few valid points I made were downvoted into oblivion due to people disliking or failing to understand them. I understand a merit system doesn\'t have this effect. But I still think that upvote / downvote systems (and potentially merit systems to a degree) could introduce more negative implications into content and user classifications than they do promote positive quirks.On the plus side, they could incentivize posters to try harder to make quality posts. It could be a good system in some respects. It could depend on how prevalent account farming is, here. To be effective the farming might have to be reduced as it opens up the system to greater exploitation. Pay for play "merit" isn\'t something I know much about. It would seem to be associated with farming, can\'t say I know much about that.'
p9
aS"It already started to have that effect I noticed after theymos's implementation of the Merit 'system'. In some cases it's very obvious that people are posting in a very forced manner to obtain a Merit or two, but at least they put time and effort into their posts, and that's something we can all be happy with, and especially so when we're a few months away from now. I am glad that theymos allocated his precious time to getting this Merit system up and running -- people for so long were complaining about theymos to not do anything about spammers, and now it shows that he does actually do something to prevent further spamming."
p10
aS'Not exactly the same, but the general idea is the same.'
p11
aS"It was just one random thread which I noticed. But take a look here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2823221.0You can see how many people are suspected that they are abusing Merit system. So, not everyone aware that they shouldn't sell merits. And I'm sure that some of these people understand and know what they are doing and how they are risking "
p12
aS"I think selling Merit points is not prohibited by the moderators if im not wrong. We can't avoid that cheating we must be friendly too so that anyone would love your post and give a damn time to click add merit. It was just like owe your kindness when you give him for return.All of us wants to have merits but not in that way selling or buying LOL.\xc2\xa0 Also we couldn't control their accounts and when a shitposter could earn high merit, this system would be useless."
p13
aS"I really hope that merits would be given to deserving members of this forum. I hope merits will be used as a mechanism to corrupt other members and\xc2\xa0 I hope merits would no be given to friends or to people they know even if their posts are not up to par with other quality posts. I am really hopeful about this new system but I'm also skeptical about its implications on new members that are working their butts off just to work up and climb their rankings. "
p14
aS'yeah this merit system would be useless if selling of merit points will chronic'
p15
aS"I also stopped using Reddit for the exact reasons you stated. It's become an echo chamber in nearly every sub, and if you bring up a question that goes against the consensus, your karma will be ruined. I agree that the merit system here is great, it will just need some tweaking especially with the supply. I think though a demerit system might not be a good idea for the exact reason that it might turn into Reddit."
p16
aS"We don't need to buy merits. Let's just make our post very useful and meaningful so that other user well send us merit because our post is constructive, useful, and meaningful. Don't buy merits because selling merit is not prohibited. "
p17
aS"I can only see the new merit system being abused by those people with multiple accounts that he can use to rank up one of his accounts for his own benefits while the good quality poster will be ignored because no one really is interested to giving merits to anybody it will just become another task for them and it's a drag. And this merit system can also be exploited by many various ways such as selling it. I also heard that DT members is putting red flags on you for meritting someone and be accused that it is your dummy account. "
p18
aS"These people who really don't know how to follow a simple words of how the merit system shall be used. Just like what I've said yesterday if they keep on abusing the system."
p19
aS'Theirs no reason to buy those merits really since we can actually earn it by posting some good quality posts and helpful ones, But we cannot please anyone to act fair since as we can see on meta their are series of events that merit system has been abused and their are guys who willing to buy it but if they found out buying it they will earned bad stake for their actions.'
p20
aS'That is perfectly put forth. I think everyone must take note of this and we should not misconfgure the whole thing. I know there are already people who are against this system or at least they belive the system isn\xc2\x92t fair for the newcomers. However, I\xc2\x92m sure the system is fully functional and will equally for newbies or legends and this can be observed with merit stats itself. There is no need to go spamming about it as it won\xc2\x92t help anyone and might take you into trouble. Let\xc2\x92s just read everyone with wide open eyes and when you really think you have seen something deserving then just merit it and be responsible about it.It\xc2\x92s that simple !'
p21
aS"Your earlier sentence is very possible for people to start abusing the system but the way the merit system is designed made it something that won't last long term the reason is that there is limited amount of merit an individual can give out and the moment he uses it to promote an account, considering the gap between a rank and another is large, he will be forced to post quality in other to get merit to move to the next rank. Opening a new account won't even solve it because that would have zero merit to give either way you will still be forced to do the right thing and that should solve the issue of DT members giving red and we all know that you don't just give 30 merits for just post we all don't agree has content.On maybe no one is interested in giving merit, you will see more of it because even me, I have given one to someone who just made sense to me and managers reading post too can give when they come across something interesting."
p22
aS'The good thing about this is that we can easily spot people out and verify that they\'re connected if something fishy is going on. Even if people make plans outside of this forum to grant merit, we can easily retrace which post the merit was added onto, and if the post is garbage, then it makes sense to flag them with red trust. I\'m thinking that this whole merit system can make it a lot easier on higher ranking members who want to help the forum out by flagging the spammers and scammers.One thing I hope doesn\'t happen in the future is the use of merit as "rep." Merit has nothing to do with reputation, and we should make it clear in the marketplace section especially that this is the case.'
p23
aS'Come on guys, problems will not occur at the first place if everyone here just followed the instructions, rules and other guidelines.Merit system is a good thing, at least we know devs are still concern about good members of this forum.If they are cheating then be it and suffer the consequences.I think the new system will also help confirming possible farm accounts.'
p24
aS"Merits are not for sale if you want also you can't,only the Smerits can be send to the person you want. First of all this system is going to suck the spammers around the forum,no more rank up with the spam posts.But sadly the quality posts are also not gonna get the enough merits,the new merits system has been implemented three days ago but still many quality posters don't get even one merits.Luckily I got just one. As per Theymos statement he will test the merits system for one or two months,if this merit is hard to achieve then changes will be made.So everyone post normally and do some contribution to the discussion don't care about merits for now."
p25
aS"I agree, the new Merit system is a good thing if everyone here in forum followed what the instruction and the rules. But now they abusing Merit point, and there's a lot of people they buy and sell their merit piont to get the bitcoin, but it's not a good way if they want to promote their account to the highest rank."
p26
aS"Haha that would backfire so hard on them! They give each other merit then they get negative trust. If you try to rig the new system you'll get rekt by the old system. HEED MY WARNINGS NEWBIES! DON'T GET NEGGED! Lol. Their will be many a legendaries with negative trust I guess."
p27
aS"It's a bad thing to buy merit for some reason, but it's possible since some of the signature campaign required a high/additional merit as possible ( to add some additional payment sounds like promotion what ever ) . But if you are bright and a good minded bitcoiner, it's easy to have it since you have sense in every thing you want to add on different threads. Just look for some interesting topic and join trading ideas with them. "
p28
aS"It's absolutely bad things and against the forum rules\xc2\xa0 to buy or selling merits, merits\xc2\xa0 maybe\xc2\xa0 will be yhe requirement to join campaign, but the campaign manager will also check the quality of the\xc2\xa0 post, so although you got the high merit but when the manager check\xc2\xa0 your\xc2\xa0 post quality maybe you wont be accepted either, so you need\xc2\xa0 to earn your merit in a correct manner"
p29
aS"Do they have some action/punishment to those who caught doing that kind of bad stuff? Or maybe some warning instead. But I think, it's gonna be additional work for all moderators and staff for sure. Good luck"
p30
aS"That's what I am afraid of.That people are going to abuse the system by trading/selling Merit.The wholr point of Merit is to show how quality are your posts, and if people will start exchanging merit , it will be impossible to know whether your post quality is high or not.Also, I think that everybody should be starting from 0 merit, and people with higher rank shouldn't be getting a higher score."
p31
aS"Starting from 0 merit is a good point, but it's already done. So it's gonna be complicated to update all merit. Just imagine how many post of hero or legendary rank made for such a several year till now. For me, its fair enough since they have a starting merit based on their rank. But just wondering, what if you rank up? Do your merit add some? "
p32
aS'This new merit implementation is a good one to reduce useless posts and it is definitely not for sale or purchase it is one of the bad thought , the reason for the implementation of Merit is for good purposes so you cannot misuse this .'
p33
aS'Well for me this new merit system will really help this forum to improve more. And the admin will screen those good poster that really deserve the promotion. Althought its quite challenging for us , but I think its for the better change. Because we can improve ourself on how we can provide a good quality and how we can contribute for the improvement of this forum.'
p34
aS'People like that are those that continually make the effort of people trying to keep the forum decent and make it more accommodating frustrated because of their actions and they are the same people that flood the entire forum with posts that are not relevant and spams which led to serious of issues. Those people should not be allowed in saner society and even a Senior member rank and bold enough to open a thread for that, its surprising.'
p35
aS'Merit is implemented for good purpose and not for sale but some people misuse this merit to rank up if you make a good and quality post you will definitely get merit in short time so post good and quality topics otherwise you will not get merit point .'
p36
aS"Its true we can earn merits by quality and useful posts but some people may face the problem to make it easily. That's why some people trying to sell merit because they know there will be some people interested to buy it especially for those who want to rank up easier without worrying about how to make good quality posts. I'm no so surprised to see some people try to sell or buy merits for their own purpose because some people has been discussing about it since the first day when theymos implemented this feature. Lets just use it when we find something that useful for us or for the community, avoid any merits sales and keep being active like before when there was no merits. "
p37
aS"It's impossible to prevent Merit sales from happening. This forum is the main hotspot for people to earn money online, and for that reason will do everything to rank up. Whatever system ends up in place to 'avoid' spam and everything related to it, people are creative enough to work around it. It's basically a catch up game for people, where at some point, catching up will be achieved one way or another. At least I so far have seen a positive change in how people write their posts, so I will start looking at newbies and other lower ranked accounts more closely to reward their efforts. The more we reward people for their efforts, the less people will try to game the system - at least, that's how I look at it."
p38
aS'About the benefits or harm of Merit to judge early. A couple of months, look at the statistics. But while it is possible to say that the newbies became more difficult, as many earlier raised their rank by spamming messages and reports. And now to me would be at least a Member will take months and maybe more (.P/S hope that the forum will become cleaner and more informative.'
p39
aS'Yes, it true but there are a lot of high rank member in this forum still try to sell or buy Merit point to get more money ). I think we no need to worry about this case cause these guys will be founded out and tagged by DT member or moderator in here. . Right at the first day when Merit point published, I saw a Hero Member wanna sell all his 200 Merit for 1m$. LOL.'
p40
aS'You cant avoid on the situation where there are really people who do tend to sell their merits since they do able to see that this is a thing which is valuable now for people in able for their ranks to go higher and instances on selling it out is there but i would say it would be useless since there are lots of eyes which would really check if somethings wrong on the merits being exchange of or being putted. Negative trust would be expected on this between the sender and receiver specially when the merits being accredited to a post which is total garbage and doesnt really worth of on putting a merit.'
p41
aS"Though merit is not for sell but some people will do this business anyhow.I saw in local board people are wanting merit for btc.So it's really hard to stop those activities We should be fare and give any members smerits for.high quality posts.I also noticed that some people are talking about just merit on Meta section seeking DT members attention to get merits."
p42
aS"I agree, it is actually not that easy to track merit sells, especially if they are not made in big amounts and arranged somehow outside the forum or in local boards. However, I guess the system will work fine eventually. It is just that some improvements and explanations should be made.Maybe it would be a good idea to set a limit of 5 merits one can give to one post, for example. At the same time, some encouraging actions should be made, because I have this feeling that most of people ignore the merits they can give to others and even when they agree with a person they don't merit him/her."
p43
aS'personally i think that this merit system have complicated the system a bit, the logic after it is good I like it, as much there are quality posts the better would this forum be but we are gonna see how merit affects the quality of posts and will people be fair to give merits.'
p44
aS"Tracking merit sales can be hard and I'm trying to think of a way to track it down or prevent it, but I'm slowly getting to conclusion that it might not be possible at all. Whoever want's to sell/buy, they can make a group on telegram or whatever and use different names and make a deal, it's simply too hard to prevent it. The only thing that's coming to mind right now is like the upvote system. Like where people would upvote comments and if that one got ~5-10 upvotes, they'd receive a merit point, of course then sMerit would be removed. This is the same situation as with illegal trades around the world, it's illegal but people will still try to do it somehow to get some more money, it's pretty normal."
p45
aS'How about helping eachother? I mean like we give our merit eachother? Its not good either in my opinion because it will give to anybody wheater they have not quality post.I know every system has pros and cons, but this system has more pros than its cons.'
p46
aS"I agree with you on this point, merit system should be more clear and it also should be more specified. I think merit system must be dependent on the quality of post but I don't know how to measure it. So when people of this forum will know that the quality of post will carry a value regarding merit point then everybody will be alert and post quality will be more informative and constructive.On the other hand, merit point should not be sold and this system must be regulated by the admin of this forum, otherwise, it will lose its quality for sure."
p47
aS'They should keep an eye on that selling of merit, we should not sell our merit because we earned that by our own hardwork.If you sell.your merit, its just like you are helping all scammers to do their evil plan. We should not tolerate that. This new system is being created for the development of the system so we just support it and do not do anything that is against it.'
p48
aS'This merit based system is one the best innovation in this forum to stamp out shitposters, more so I am imploring the admins to closely monitor how merits is awarded so as make the system credible however \xc2\xa0some unscrupulous members\xc2\xa0 might want to bend rules and messed up the system such a member should be sanctioned accordingly.'
p49
aS'Ooh you use reverse psychology for gaining merit. Say something nice and get merit from people here. Very nice trick. In our school back in the day, you had to work hard to get merit, but this here seems like, just be nice, fake and people will +merit you. I wish I could de-merit you right now. Oh well, I do not run this forum. '
p50
aS'What kind of people are you if you want to sell even merit for money, resourceful or greedy ?. But one thing I really sure in this world,"money can\'t change you, but money help you to see what you really are" ( deep awakening monster?) . Just adding idea from the other side, hope no one will offended. '
p51
aS"It's hard but through this page https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=merit;u=xxxxxx we can figure out on who are those people abusing the merit system. If someone sends to an unfamiliar posts that isn't high quality and was given the maximum one, isn't that fishy?"
p52
aS'Of course it must be not a sold its form of Crime ,the real merit purpose is to examine the quality of useful post right ,for newbie dont be discouraged if not get the merit and anyway this feature is very useful for manager and also staff to make it easier for them to assess poster someone ,I personally strongly agree it triggers me to make it better post so I can be useful to others'
p53
aS'Yes, this system is introduced to maintain the posts quality n the forum and also the richness of the forum as there are many shit posters out there who are making this forum just a\xc2\xa0 place to earn money. This will make the form a better place to find knowledgeable peoples. As many people are supporting this system we too should make a good approach to it and see that no one encourages the sales of this merits in the forum.'
p54
aS'along with the increasingly rampant newbie account that makes a lot of people who just babble without understanding what the discussion is being discussed,but maybe for some people this becomes a land to find additional money.by selling the merit rations...'
p55
aS'Merit system of course will hugely increase the quality of posts for merit is the only way to rank up.As for paid merits, buying them away from this forum would be a hassle and as you need a lot of them from a lot of people.'
p56
aS'Nothing can be done for such people who do not even understand what is the benefit or how beneficial it can be in long run if you use wisely and correctly. For smaller amount of money if they are doing this at the end when the admin would reconcile all this people would be banned and thus all their efforts will gets waste. Hopefully people will learn and would not commit any such mistake.'
p57
aS'I am a bit surprised by the Merit system, but I get used to it over time, and if it is abused against the merit system, the rules of the forum may become stricter. For those who produce quality content, there has never been a problem, no more.'
p58
aS"I hope that everyone could understand and follow this new merit system to be fair to all and to clean this forum up. But sadly there are still some people that don't follow the rules and cheat to gain profit. I believe that all implemented system are good and for the benefits of everyone here, but there is just some people who breaks it for their own sake."
p59
aS'what depends on merit?'
p60
aS'What Op has stated as the last point adds value to the entire merit system that has come to effect with the hard effort of theymos. Merit system will ensure obedience among the users allowing them to improve the quality of posts. The merit one gains will make them stand away from common posters. Everything has got loophole, so making it functional with cent percent effective need to be prioritized.'

aS'Merit is an additional requirement in order to promote a rank of a user, it may be an additional burden to other user but for me it serves as inspiration and a high morale to a user because it is equivalent for a appreciation to your post. '
p62
aS'Although merit is being bought and sold it will definitely increase the posting quality in Bitcointalk. A big portion of the users will need to work harder and these who deserve it will rank up, a minority will rank up due to purchasing merit and accounts, however the amount of garbage in the forum will diminish and people motivation will change which is the important.'
p63
aS'Exactly, with in days we cannot judge how merit system is going to work. To get full information we have to wait for another 1 or 2 month to get answers for merit system.'
p64
aS"The merit system has nothing to do with posts' quality, that is just a pretext.It's only real ain is to keep away people like me from signature campaign.Vip people don't like concurrence."
p65
aS'I couldn\'t agree more. May be the intentions are good, but the results are without any sense.For example, I can\'t give you any merit. And I understand that - out of an elite of "gods" in the forum, even full or senior have a very limited number or merits to give. It\'s just a way to stop the growth of the beginners. '
p66
aS"As a complete beginner, it seems to me that I have only a remote possibility to grow in this system.I heard that there is the possibility to make promotion campaign just to earn something, but they are reserved to senior.It seems to me very difficult to earn this kind of points. We'll see."
p67
aS'This system encourage each user to post a worthy one, if you are a quality poster then you dont have any problem to get merit because higher ranks tend to give their smerit to the good posters so they can rank up accordingly. Nowadays what others most concern about is to rank up fast (regardless of their post quality) hence they can join in campaign and this system is the answer to reduce the shitposts.'
p68
aS'We must be responsible about this merit system because if you do sold your smerit, you will surely face huge consequence for that action. If you find it hard to get some merit then you must be creative because not everyone who post quality got some merit, some who got merits are comes from their skills to help people. '
p69
aS"Can anyone here know how many merit can I use in one day?\xc2\xa0 or even based on your rank? Cause there's a lot of bitcoiner/message that I want to send merit because of good sense of post. Just giving merit to those who are worthy to have. "
p70
aS'every person is responsible for every merit they have, no one knows for what they use it, in order to get the merit we are required to make a quality post so that people acknowledge and give merit to the post, but there are some irresponsible people who sell merit them for a few dollars, they do not care about the quality of posts they have, by buying they think it will be fast for the future they reach the desired rank, so there is no need for any achievements they do'
p71
aS"Well definitely you have a point. After admin theymos make a solution for this dying forum , there are still a lot of people who continue to wreck this forum. Because they are choose to sell their merit rarher than giving it to the person who deserve it. But like what other always say' those who will be caught abusing the merit system will be punish."
p72
aS'The decision of adding the merit points as condition for members\xc2\xa0 to move up in ranks, is a great one. Now, only those who know, what to write and how to write will get what they deserve (better ranks). I believe that this new system truly distinguish those who have a good english from those with bad one. And this, will help our community evolve.It is true that many may see this as an oppotunity to sell/buy merits, but i hope they won\'t do it. What moderateers are here for? i am sure they did put this into consideration when they thought of this new system. and i believe that they will find out and know whenever someone abuse the "merit points". That is why i think that the "good" members will be fine.Let\'s just all believe in the people of our great community, and like you said, let\'s work our asses off.'
p73
aS"You will not rank up anymore unless you'll get the right amount of merit for your ranking up to senior member which is 250. Activity isn't the only requirement you'll need to rank up so even you'll have 240 activity but you haven't reached 250 merit, you will remain full member. That's fine that you'll give merit to those people who are worthy of it and you'll do it right. There are more tips found in this thread."
p74
aS"Its purpose is not to limit you from entering a campaign because there are many other ways to do it like allowing you to rank up and then banning you or painting you red to make all of that time and effort go to waste. Merit was introduced to limit spam and account farming. When a shitposter finds himself waiting months just to get a member status he'll either start posting like a normal person or leave the forum. You can't give merit to others because you haven't produced any content yet! If newbies could give each other merit spammers and farmers would make 100 new accounts just to level up 1 with merit. Why does every new user want to become recognized since day 1 and have all the privileges? Are you guys so detached from reality or is it greed speaking?"
p75
aS'I already wrote in another topic for sale / purchase merit. The whole problem is the deficit of merit, so it becomes valuable and there are precedents for sell. When the merit will be more than necessary, then the process of rewarding quality posts will occur naturally (if there are many merits, then there will be many offers for sale and the price for sale will be so low that it will be uninteresting for sellers to risk and sell their measures for a pittance). This is a simple rule of supply and demand.'
p76
aS"Now merit is important for account increase the rank and it help to entering the campaign. But merit was limit one. So you will safe to use and don't wast your merit. If need to merit you improve your post quality. If no one send merit in your account your account rank is not increase. So if need to improve your account rank. Post quality is must. "
p77
aS'I see some DT members are also simply sharing the merits each other for the shit posts. Now we see many newbies creates the shit threads in the bitcoin discussion, economics and speculation section. People simply making posts also sometime makes the decent post but the people who know about merits like the concern post. I am sure they will share that to them. No need to worry about it buddy.As Theymos said, this will be considered as test check soon he will understand how it is going in the forum and reconsider with merit points for the each rank upgrade.'
p78
aS'Actually im seeing this new merit system do have its advantage and disadvantages as well and im sure most of us is already aware on the things that are happening as of now. I do see some equality on this matter where only popular person would really have the chance or commonly get some merits. I have lurked this forum and even some good and informative post doesnt really been given a merit. Im sure it is really a good post but you are nobody on this forum where it is expected there would really be no merit for you.'
p79
aS"Great thread for bring up the attention to everyone. It's a good start with the additional rating system. Still need more time to iron out the details."
p80
aS"I just want to add, merit can not be mocked just by a friendship or partnership, there may be some in this forum who have partners to manage campaigns or whatever. Keep behaving justly at all, there is no good reason to give a merit to a close friend or work partner, it's the same as selling a merit in my opinion."
p81
aS'I completely agree, the status should be deservedly received. If they had not introduced Merit, the forum would have turned into one big bounty company.'
p82
aS'I do not know how about merit update.Can anybody tell me how to see merit upgrade. I see my merit is 10 and no raise to higher.Why is bitcointalk upgrading more merit, it only makes multiple acount clone support each other.If update, I thinks better is using code 2FA'
p83
aS'Merits are given to posts that are useful and constructive. Yup its hard to get a single merit but we need to work hard for it. We must improve our post/s and make sure that those are of high quality, and can give us additional information or new knowledge. Lets all be fair when it comes to this merit system. Its not all about ranking up, but what we can contribute to the world of digital currency.'
p84
aS'Yes,I agree merits are really not for sale.But why the people keep repeating the sane asnwers over and over.The implementation on merit system is to stop the spam posts but now people are spamming with merit system.OP LOCK THIS THREAD TO STOP SPAM POSTS.'
p85
aS"I completely agree, but I think it's okay than selling your merit. Cause selling merit, sound like buying the service of others to get your account famous for an instant. Instant is good but hard work is worth it and favorable on my own view. "
p86
aS"This will how the forum runs from this day on, yeah there's still some who'll give merit to others that really have a good posts but the majority will just be a friendship merit.I understand what the moderators are trying to do and it's good tho but the system won't run the way they wanted it to be."
p87
aS'Sorry but,I just observe this, having a merit points is not easy.Because as you can see, many of us ignore the merit system. Some bitcoiner make thread like this just to make some noise that "HEY, I HAVE A GOOD POST THAN OTHERS(its long paragraph) send me merit now" by providing their own link post. How cruel... '
p88
aS"\xc2\xa0Common mate anybody has different view of this new feature, and for you to know I am not promoting any of it here. I want to speak out loud to let people like us that we don't have to do buy and selling merits, even thou its easy or hard for any individuals. \xc2\xa0let us always remind ourself that we should show professional courtesy to ourselves and to others.\xc2\xa0 "
p89
aS"It is not easy because people like you are not sending merits. You shouldn't ignore system.Don't be jealous."
p90
aS'Yes we all know that selling merit is not prohibited by the administration. \xc2\xa0You can get merits by constructing a very useful post and meaningful. Merit is the points given to you by the other users if you helped them by your post.'
p91
aS"I don't know why people keep on whining or seems to be jealous among others post. Instead on minding others post better to mind your own on how you do accumulate merits.This would really be a test differentiating a good quality and a shit poster but it cant really be avoided that someone or people do abuse this system which we have seen already."
p92
aS"It's obvious, people look to rank up by getting the required Merit count, where they see how others are being awarded Merits for their posts, even if the post is indeed written for the sole purpose of receiving Merits, and how they themselves aren't getting anything. It's simple, people want to rank up to make their account be eligible for signature campaigns, and when they see others are doing better in that regard, it stings them. And yes, they should be minding their own business -- if people opening threads spend as much effort into getting their posts quality up, they would probably have earned a few Merits already...."
p93
aS'I also dont like this merit system. There are disadvantages to it but as you have said, we need to abide by the rules and besides, there is not much we can do about it but obey. Anyway, maybe one day theymos will change his mind regarding this matter and i hope he will make some better changes on this.\xc2\xa0 '
p94
aS"Yes, I think so, merit is not for sales I stopped Like this think as I know very difficult to get merit points but it's necessary to legality for Bitcoin Forum. this way is very important for all, merit system will probit good result for hard working and no way for the shortcut. I think it's very bad to think merit selling and buying maybe some people will choose it but it's not the right way. finally, I am happy with the merit system."
p95
aS'If you see someone spamming you could just press the "report to moderator" to submit those posts that made you think it\'s spam and add a comment saying the post is a repeated/paraphrased answer so the mods could quickly understand. If OP lock the thread then other users including newbies won\'t see the thread anymore. \xc2\xa0If the merits gave a negative impact on the forum maybe he would but for now it\'s unlikely that he\'ll make some changes to the merit system.'
p96
aS'how to get merit?'
p97
aS'Rewarding merits to insubstantial posts or rewarding for the reason for friend or anything else must be a breach of forum rules and which may lead to get negged. We need to understand the true purpose of merit system and we must contribute up to the level we can for fighting against spamming.Just write quality posts. As simple as 123...'
p98
aS"I felt sad regarding this issue, the purpose of merit is to improved ourselves to give quality post. Selling merit is not helping' you just torelating them not to improved themselves, it is a part of the rule so we need to follow."
p99
aS"But that's not always the case that people do easily get merits even on good post made by them they aren't still getting some merit which it would really be hard on ranking it up. Somehow I do think off that if you are a person which don't have any friends or not quiet popular then it would really be a disadvantage for you but yet there are still people would really recognize your good post."
p100
aS'That is perfectly put forth. I think everyone must take note of this and we should not misconfgure the whole thing. I know there are already people who are against this system or at least they belive the system isn\xc2\x92t fair for the newcomers. However, I\xc2\x92m sure the system is fully functional and will equally for newbies or legends and this can be observed with merit stats itself. There is no need to go spamming about it as it won\xc2\x92t help anyone and might take you into trouble. Let\xc2\x92s just read everyone with wide open eyes and when you really think you have seen something deserving then just merit it and be responsible about it.It\xc2\x92s that simple !'
p101
aS"Your earlier sentence is very possible for people to start abusing the system but the way the merit system is designed made it something that won't last long term the reason is that there is limited amount of merit an individual can give out and the moment he uses it to promote an account, considering the gap between a rank and another is large, he will be forced to post quality in other to get merit to move to the next rank. Opening a new account won't even solve it because that would have zero merit to give either way you will still be forced to do the right thing and that should solve the issue of DT members giving red and we all know that you don't just give 30 merits for just post we all don't agree has content.On maybe no one is interested in giving merit, you will see more of it because even me, I have given one to someone who just made sense to me and managers reading post too can give when they come across something interesting."
p102
aS'The good thing about this is that we can easily spot people out and verify that they\'re connected if something fishy is going on. Even if people make plans outside of this forum to grant merit, we can easily retrace which post the merit was added onto, and if the post is garbage, then it makes sense to flag them with red trust. I\'m thinking that this whole merit system can make it a lot easier on higher ranking members who want to help the forum out by flagging the spammers and scammers.One thing I hope doesn\'t happen in the future is the use of merit as "rep." Merit has nothing to do with reputation, and we should make it clear in the marketplace section especially that this is the case.'
p103
aS'Come on guys, problems will not occur at the first place if everyone here just followed the instructions, rules and other guidelines.Merit system is a good thing, at least we know devs are still concern about good members of this forum.If they are cheating then be it and suffer the consequences.I think the new system will also help confirming possible farm accounts.'
p104
aS"Merits are not for sale if you want also you can't,only the Smerits can be send to the person you want. First of all this system is going to suck the spammers around the forum,no more rank up with the spam posts.But sadly the quality posts are also not gonna get the enough merits,the new merits system has been implemented three days ago but still many quality posters don't get even one merits.Luckily I got just one. As per Theymos statement he will test the merits system for one or two months,if this merit is hard to achieve then changes will be made.So everyone post normally and do some contribution to the discussion don't care about merits for now."
p105
aS"I agree, the new Merit system is a good thing if everyone here in forum followed what the instruction and the rules. But now they abusing Merit point, and there's a lot of people they buy and sell their merit piont to get the bitcoin, but it's not a good way if they want to promote their account to the highest rank."
p106
aS"Haha that would backfire so hard on them! They give each other merit then they get negative trust. If you try to rig the new system you'll get rekt by the old system. HEED MY WARNINGS NEWBIES! DON'T GET NEGGED! Lol. Their will be many a legendaries with negative trust I guess."
p107
aS"It's a bad thing to buy merit for some reason, but it's possible since some of the signature campaign required a high/additional merit as possible ( to add some additional payment sounds like promotion what ever ) . But if you are bright and a good minded bitcoiner, it's easy to have it since you have sense in every thing you want to add on different threads. Just look for some interesting topic and join trading ideas with them. "
p108
aS"It's absolutely bad things and against the forum rules\xc2\xa0 to buy or selling merits, merits\xc2\xa0 maybe\xc2\xa0 will be yhe requirement to join campaign, but the campaign manager will also check the quality of the\xc2\xa0 post, so although you got the high merit but when the manager check\xc2\xa0 your\xc2\xa0 post quality maybe you wont be accepted either, so you need\xc2\xa0 to earn your merit in a correct manner"
p109
aS"Do they have some action/punishment to those who caught doing that kind of bad stuff? Or maybe some warning instead. But I think, it's gonna be additional work for all moderators and staff for sure. Good luck"
p110
aS"That's what I am afraid of.That people are going to abuse the system by trading/selling Merit.The wholr point of Merit is to show how quality are your posts, and if people will start exchanging merit , it will be impossible to know whether your post quality is high or not.Also, I think that everybody should be starting from 0 merit, and people with higher rank shouldn't be getting a higher score."
p111
aS"Starting from 0 merit is a good point, but it's already done. So it's gonna be complicated to update all merit. Just imagine how many post of hero or legendary rank made for such a several year till now. For me, its fair enough since they have a starting merit based on their rank. But just wondering, what if you rank up? Do your merit add some? "
p112
aS'This new merit implementation is a good one to reduce useless posts and it is definitely not for sale or purchase it is one of the bad thought , the reason for the implementation of Merit is for good purposes so you cannot misuse this .'
p113
aS'Well for me this new merit system will really help this forum to improve more. And the admin will screen those good poster that really deserve the promotion. Althought its quite challenging for us , but I think its for the better change. Because we can improve ourself on how we can provide a good quality and how we can contribute for the improvement of this forum.'
p114
aS'People like that are those that continually make the effort of people trying to keep the forum decent and make it more accommodating frustrated because of their actions and they are the same people that flood the entire forum with posts that are not relevant and spams which led to serious of issues. Those people should not be allowed in saner society and even a Senior member rank and bold enough to open a thread for that, its surprising.'
p115
aS'Merit is implemented for good purpose and not for sale but some people misuse this merit to rank up if you make a good and quality post you will definitely get merit in short time so post good and quality topics otherwise you will not get merit point .'
p116
aS"Its true we can earn merits by quality and useful posts but some people may face the problem to make it easily. That's why some people trying to sell merit because they know there will be some people interested to buy it especially for those who want to rank up easier without worrying about how to make good quality posts. I'm no so surprised to see some people try to sell or buy merits for their own purpose because some people has been discussing about it since the first day when theymos implemented this feature. Lets just use it when we find something that useful for us or for the community, avoid any merits sales and keep being active like before when there was no merits. "
p117
aS"It's impossible to prevent Merit sales from happening. This forum is the main hotspot for people to earn money online, and for that reason will do everything to rank up. Whatever system ends up in place to 'avoid' spam and everything related to it, people are creative enough to work around it. It's basically a catch up game for people, where at some point, catching up will be achieved one way or another. At least I so far have seen a positive change in how people write their posts, so I will start looking at newbies and other lower ranked accounts more closely to reward their efforts. The more we reward people for their efforts, the less people will try to game the system - at least, that's how I look at it."
p118
aS'About the benefits or harm of Merit to judge early. A couple of months, look at the statistics. But while it is possible to say that the newbies became more difficult, as many earlier raised their rank by spamming messages and reports. And now to me would be at least a Member will take months and maybe more (.P/S hope that the forum will become cleaner and more informative.'
p119
aS'Yes, it true but there are a lot of high rank member in this forum still try to sell or buy Merit point to get more money ). I think we no need to worry about this case cause these guys will be founded out and tagged by DT member or moderator in here. . Right at the first day when Merit point published, I saw a Hero Member wanna sell all his 200 Merit for 1m$. LOL.'

S'Hi, I am looking for a way to earn some money without invest(because I am broke), I can dedicate 2 hours a day in that. what can I do to make a bitcoin per month without any investment?'
p1
aS"What can you do? Have you got any skills? If so, you could provide some freelance type service in exchange for BTC, or for $ and then just buy BTC with that.If you're not skilled in any area, you can, you know, just look for a part-time min wage job (or similar, ie. become Uber driver etc) and use your earnings to buy bitcoins, if that's what you want."
p2
aS"You can access the freelancer websites.Many online jobs there.But, since you aren't an investor, i think its hard to gain 1 btc/month. Its possible if you want to work hard."
p3
aS'you cannot earn money without investing,if earning money is a very easy deal then everyone in bitcointalk would have being millionaires ,nothing can be achieved without doing anything,if you have any technical skills you could earn money or just go for a regular job and convert those to bitcoin '
p4
aS"I don't understand where you get the logic that you need to inest money in\xc2\xa0 able to earn. You sir need to find a job. Like you mention, you are broke, only way you can earn bitcoin (money) you need to get yourself a job. Get up and look away in the computer and apply for a decent job that can support your living."
p5
aS'Thank you everyone, I am working at this time, what happen is that Im also in the collegue and I need more money because what I am making right now barely support me for living. I said bitcoin because this is a bitcoin forum but at the end Im just looking for money. Since I dont have time to get another job, I just thought may be something I can do online, I just saw about be a blogger and now I will verify about freelancer and minijobs.Sorry If I gave you the idea that I am looking for a magical trick.Thank you!'
p6
aS"Get a job OP... You won't earn bitcoin in a month if you would just dedicate atleast 2 hours a day, you will earn dust with that but I think you won't reach your goal...\xc2\xa0 Is this your first time to use bitcoin? if you are planning to earn bitcoin for a living, well, I'm afraid you need have more time to do it... You could go to the services section and look for jobs that you can do... Anyway, welcome and good vibes...\xc2\xa0 "
p7
aS'You can simply trade in altcoins to make bitcoins or you can do signature campaigns, the fact is that trading is risky and signature campaigns are not payed very well (depending on which you pick).'
p8
aS"I think it is impossible to get 1 BTC per month and without investment and even you can't do hardwork more than\xc2\xa0 2 hours . I will suggest you to collect some BTC and then make a faucet site anf through advertising you will get above of 1 BTC per Month ."
p9
aS"Well, if you are just starting to have business with bitcoin and you don't have any fund to start with, then I can suggest that you must start first by joining signature campaigns. Somehow by that you will get paid. And you can start saving your earnings until it expand. And then you can start investing and trading if you have already enough funds. "
p10
aS'freelancer can earn 1 BTC in a month or two, if he has the capability to do high skill needing jobs.There are freelancing sites that offers BTC as a payment for any task they needed to be done.\xc2\xa0 This task ranges from simple clicks to programming.\xc2\xa0 Dependent in your skill, you can earn more than 1 BTC if you have the skill and talent that the company needs.\xc2\xa0 Another option is to be a member of an affiliate club where you can build your downline and enable you to earn residual income from it.'
p11
aS'it depends on the type of job that you can find online to pay you bitcoin, most of the things you can find will only pay a very small amount and in one month you are not going to be able to make that much.also the time you want to dedicate to earning it is a bit low, you need to spend more time.'
p12
aS"2 hours a day? I think that's too short to make money with bitcoin. Most of those big earners almost dedicate most of their day time in earning bitcoin. So I think you won't be earning big\xc2\xa0 if that's only two hours a day. Better try online jobs that your skills would fit. Or just find a day job, that would earn you more than one bitcoin.\xc2\xa0 "
p13
aS'2 Hours a day is pretty short, do signature campaigns in that time, if it helps you a bit. Or you can use skills like blogging/programming, but 2 hours wont get you much. Try out the freelancer jobs, they will help you, but wont make you rich overnight.'
p14
aS"Yeah that's pretty short. Even if you offer a services it may took up to 2 hours or so. If you really want to earn some bitcoins, you must have time for it. If you join Signature Campaign, you can't post without interval because you will be accused with spamming. And if you are going to trade, you have to wait for the market to be active. Allotting 2 hours is pretty short and will not guarantee you can make bitcoin from it."
p15
aS"I would suggest you to work for fiat and if you want, convert that money into bitcoins. It's easier that way.2 hours a day * 60 days = 120 hours. Btc is $713 right now so $713/120 = $5.94/hr. Quite a few countries have a minimum wage of at least $5.94/hr and this will get you a bitcoin in two months. Even if the minimum wage is less than $5.94, you can compensate that by working more than two hours (There aren't many jobs that require you to work only 2 hours a day anyway)"
p16
aS"it all depends on what you can do. to earn 1 bitcoin in 2 months you need to earn nearly 0.016BTC a day which may not seem much in fiat terms (around $11 a day) but when it comes to online job and making bitcoin it becomes a bit harder if you don't have prior experiences.you can always offer services like designing, translation, selling goods digital or physical, coding, and so many more but you have to have some skills."
p17
aS'Start getting some skills together, either writing, coding, graphic design or something else that you can apply when it comes to jobs over the internet, and then find someone willing to use your services, more than likely in the "services" section of the forum.Do a signature campaign as well, it helps to keep you busy during the downtime and make a bit of money as well.Making 1 BTC per month starting from what is effectively nothing is an incredibly difficult task. 2 hours per day likely won\'t be enough.'
p18
aS"It's always the same with that kind of question.If you have skills, use them. Maybe with an online job that pays you bitcoins, maybe with a real job where you earn fiat.When you have no skills, well, it's gonna be hard. Money comes not out of nowhere.There are a lot of people out there without any skills all wondering how they can earn money. Those who have found a way won't tell. They don't need the competition."

p20
aS'Some corporations pay to their employees in Bitcoin. I think that working at such a company is an available and stable opportunity to earn 1 or more BTC in a few months. Investments rarely have that return unless you have much to risk, but if you had, you would not ask this question, I guess. So, I advise you to try to find a real job for BTC. To be honest, I am doing the same\xc2\xa0 '
p21
aS'Makes 1 bitcoin in a month without investment? Maybe you can use a signature campaign to get bitcoin, but if you rely on a signature campaign is not enough. So you can try other ways such as selling services. If many who use your services you certainly can collect 1 bitcoin in a month.'
p22
aS"It's always about the skills bro, you have to be skillful to earn up to or even more than one Bitcoin a month. You can take up task, in the service session. But, two hours is very small if truly you want to earn Bitcoin"
p23
aS'To earn that huge amount, you must have had a good skill with which you may start offering in exchange for bitcoin. Just advertise your skill here on the forum and many other places, people who need your services will pay good money for it, that may make you to earn more than one bitcoin also within a month.'
p24
aS'I have been here for quite a number of months and I havent made that much but that dosent mean anyone cant make it happen, in my own point of view it depends on the level of risk you are willing to take and since you said you dont want any investment and your current rank then signature campaigns wont do the magic even if you rank higher. So you are left with two options in my own opinion which is either gambling or sell your skills.

aS"You need to find a work paying a good salary. To find a work like that, you need skills. If you don't have any skills, will be very hard to earn 1 btc in a month or two...With small tasks on forum you won't be able to earn that amount. If you really want to earn big, study something and offer your professional service later."
p27
aS'I agree that OP need a work on this.\xc2\xa0 Earning 1 BTC a month needs a huge capital for investment.\xc2\xa0 Most legit company offers upto 5% monthly so if you need to earn 1 BTC thru investment, you need to invest 20 BTC to earn 1 BTC per month.\xc2\xa0 or you can participate in an ICO and pray that your investment will be 10x higher when the ICO coin hits an exchange platform.'
p28
aS"You know, 1BTC/month is good salary in some countries, maybe its 1BTC but it is still 700$. With only 2hours/day i don't think you can earn it without any investment. If you have some skills you can offer them here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0 or try with freelancing sites. "
p29
aS'if you are doing freelance jobs you have to spend some time with the project or work in hand ,blogging is definitely a way to make some money if you are very good in writing and have certain ideas and these jobs are not meant to make any one rich'
p30
aS"Make your own blog, use your hand, use your brain, offering your ideas and service like writing essay or article for this, or you can try becoming a freelance, at the same time you can try for learning the video designer. that's a lot of ways and you can roll your faucet too. but back to the general things what's your skill dude? NO CAPITAL = OFFERING YOUR SKILL, NO SKILL= OFFERING YOUR CAPITAL."
p31
aS"I saw a casino investiment where a guy invested 1 BTC and earn 0.5 BTC after 3-4 months. Considering it, you can invest 4 BTCs on the casino and make your goal of 1 BTC every 2 months... Need a high investiment and it's not guaranteed to have this amount, but good possibility.You can work also and earn your month wage and exchange it into BTCs. To make real and big money, you need work hard, be very lucky or steal a bank.\xc2\xa0 "
p32
aS'So do you want to earn 700 USD in 2 hours a day?If you know how to do this, please tell to everybody because it can save the world.Max you will earn without invest with this time is 0,001 bitcoin/month.'
p33
aS"There is no easy way to earn more bitcoin in just couple of days and month except if you are a business man in real world then you make a website accepting bitcoin as payment method then its not impossible but if you start from nothing then you will start also from nothing.\xc2\xa0 But if you have skills like web developing , graphic designing you can make\xc2\xa0 that but not just a month but its months don't know how many months because it always depends on you. "
p34
aS"If you dont have a capital to start for its,really hard to have it.1 months or 2months is not enough from nothing. but good news it's really posible to have it but need to be patient . Start with signature campaign or altcoin campaign create an account on exchange and start to learn more about trading it will help you to have your goal much easier signature campaign + trading I think you can have it 1BTC .but $700 in two hours you need to be pro it's really really hard.

And you ask how to earn 1 btc in a month just spending 2 hours, it's ridiculous man Earn 1 btc in a month is need more spending time than work at McDonald, why?

p38
aS"Lots of tasks to do here and there but I don't think 2 hours a day will give you 1 bitcoin in a month. If such method exists, then I think it would require a lot of capital. Hard work is the key but so is time. No matter how hard you work in 2 hours, you will not get 1 bitcoin a month. But I guess if you're good at sales and you can look for something that you can buy for a really low price and then sell at a really high price, you'll be able to make 1 bitcoin in a month."
p39
aS'I doubt you will be able to earn 1 bitcoin montly, but if you have an amazing writing english, its possible you achieve near, with signatures, but its a hard work and should take more then 2 hours daily.'
p40

aS'I am here to actually learn from those who are actually making that much in which I know is possible as some will even be making more than that.

p42
aS'Do you mean signature making or signature campaign? Well you can actually earn 1btc if you are a good designer and also got many costumers who hired you to make them an signatures to be used in their campaign, but if you mean in signature campaign well its totally impossible since mostly sig campaigns gives 0.03-0.04 weekly and that is to far to became a 1 btc, byt if you got so many alts and make sig farming well you can avhieve that 1 btc wants. But totally its not recommended here in this furom.'

aS"Will be hard for you get 1 or 2 bitcoin in a month or two, although you can make investment into bitcoins or altcoins (trading).

Btw good luck."
p45
aS"1 bitcoin is more possible than 2 bitcoin but if you will just going to be a starter that is going to be an hard way to even get 0.5 BTC / month. But if you have a lot of source like trading, having your own blog site that has a lot of visitors and readers and add up the monetization of youtube's video then that will make it happen."
p46
aS"OP was very clear when he said he is broke and don't have any money to invest. Also he said he has a job, but he can barely live with his salary, so i don't think buying bitcoin is a option for him. Robbing a bank or any kind of criminal activities are not good advice to any person, especially if they are broke, because even you are joking someone without options can take you very serious. "
p47
aS"Find work in your workplace. Try to extend your application outside the real world and not by relying only on online works. Then use those salaries of your to buy bitcoin. It's not with 2 hours a day dedication but setting your goals in a fixed and regular basis.You know you are the only who can answer specifically that question since you know yourself than anyone else here. Find and think those possible works that can give you comfortability when doing it so that you are just playing on how to earn bitcoin."
p48
aS'Exactly, It is quite funny but since this guy is still a newbie then it is still quite considerable. \xc2\xa0We just have to let him understand that 1btc in a month is not that easy unlike getting the first bucks but not impossible tho \xc2\xa0'
p49
aS"put $20/day into bitcoin. youll have almost a full coin after a month.if you're broke, go prostitute yourself for $20/day"
p50
aS'Its hard to earn one bitcoin in a month without any investment unless you have some really great technical skills that you can use to earn bitcoins, if you think you have some skills just open a thread offering your skills to the community and you will get hired.'
p51
aS'how could got 1 btc per month with only 2 hours working everyday i also wondering for that and i think that was impossible because for those who dedicate more work hours but the results still even less than 1 btc and if you want to got 1 btc per month it all depend on your attempt because in my opinion more salary means more working hard and if you only could spend 2 hours per day then there is no way to get 1 btc per month '
p52
aS'find a real job and after one months convert the salary in BTC.\xc2\xa0 '
p53
aS'Yeah. haha  That was realistic huh. Well honestly speaking, Yes. In order to have a 1 Bitcoin easily. Find a Job. If you are pertaining to work in this Bitcoin community. It is hard to earn one bitcoin if you do not have that Capital to start With. Starting from zero. I think the range of having one bitcoin is like three to four months of active in this sideline. But, if you have like 2 BTC capital, trading is the best. You can even have 1 bitcoin profit in a week or so depending on the strategy you are using.'
p54
aS"Only someone with great skills can do this without any investments because the only way to earn a lot of bitcoins without investing anything is to sell your services to the community, if you think you can do that then great, if you think you can't then better not to dream about earning 1 bitcoin in a month or two."
p55
aS'It is possible. Follow these steps and you can achieve your goal-1. Find some really good paying faucets, small tasks.2. Bookmark those sites, or maybe you could make your own rotator3. Dont waste your time finding new faucets.\xc2\xa0According to me, after following these three steps you would get about 0.001 btc \xc2\xa0in a week.That amount would not be a big contribution to your earnings. So the main thing, \xc2\xa0while browsing those faucet, try to learn the working of faucets, working Bitcoin transactions, etc.4. Write a blog about Bitcoin faucets, Bitcoin working, etc.5. Now, there are many ICO going on for the genesis of new coins like Bitcoin. You have a Bitcointalk account. Learn about those Ico and the idea behind the coin. Ask the founders, if you have questions btt.Now that you have understood the coin, try promote it and gain some bounties.6. While you are making posts on btt, put a signature to get side income of Bitcoins.Do this for 2 weeks, you get around \xc2\xa00.07 btc. (Earnings from Ico not counted, as get them after the ico ends)7. Now head on to freelancing sites. If you have some skills, try to find a matching job. Example- excel data entry, write paid articles, \xc2\xa0geurilla advertising, etc.8. While doing this , continue to use btt for all following weeks.\xc2\xa0Buy Hash power at cloud mining websites ( a bit risky). \xc2\xa0Get the regular payouts till the end of 2 months and then sell your Hash power (you can use hashflare this, they allow selling of Hash rate for lifetime contacts)Do this for 2 weeks, you will own about 0.3 btc in total till now.9. Learn about trading currencies. Although it requires some skills, but many times it easy to predict market.Normally, \xc2\xa0if Devs of a coin attend a meeting/ summit , price increases. If there is some hack price falls. Buy low, sell high.10. Continue doing freelancing jobs and using btt.Continue these steps till the end .Claim the bounties of ICO.Now you would have earned 1 btc the end of 2 months. Note: if you you already know about Bitcoin you can skip 1-3 steps.Disclaimer: it is your money, make decisions after doing your own research. I cannot gaurantee 1 btc at end of the period. Your earnings largely depend on your skills and time management.Well, the best method as suggested by someone some posts ago, Find a job in real world. It normally pays more for the same amount of work.'
p56
aS"most people here giving an advice that if you have some skills to offer then you have an advantage and a chance to make earn some profit and they're all right . but as what you have said you can only dedicate 2 hours every day for doing some services to make a bitcoin in a month and I think 2 hours a day is not enough for you to make it possible ."
p57
aS'I do believe its possible to have more then one account at different signature, but as i said with 2 hours its impossible to get such income, and as you stated you earn something like0,03-0,04btc weekly, be present at more then one signature as i know its possible, doesnt have nothing to do with sig farming as you saying there. I believe i had saw a single user with 10 accounts in the past at bitmixer, i do believe its banned at the moment.'
p58
aS'yes, no skills is almost impossible to get a Bitcoin in such a short time. Try to sell your account. In this forum, it seems to me allowed'
p59
aS'Selling his account wont earn him what he is desiring for because he is just having one account that wont earn him more than 0.05 bitcoins if it is even Sr. member, maybe he can earn that amount by selling other things but that wont be earning at all because he will be giving away something in order to get money so that is not called earning.'
p60
aS'Sell your belongings or stuffs\xc2\xa0 which you do not use anymore.\xc2\xa0 The money you get from your stuff you will use it to buy btc and starts trading bitcoin '
p61

p62
aS'You can look and see what pays well on the freelancer sites.\xc2\xa0 Then if you have any natural talents or can pick something to learn.'
p63
aS'I could go and do it in a few months. The reason of me writing this that I will have to participate in a trainee program and I will have to work for a low salary in this program. Since the salary will be low anyway, I am thinking of converting it into BTC in the hope of a rising slope. I am still studying and I have an other source of income to support my studies so an experiment like it should not be a big problem for me. I could write a handbook from the experience '
p64
aS" I'm surely nowadays few number of a faucet site owners can gain bellow one Bitcoin per moth.\xc2\xa0after adsense bans,bots and ad-blockers have ruined this business already. "
p65
aS"Some people work 8 hours a day or more and can't earn 1 bitcoin within a month or two.And without investment I doubt how can you earn those, unless you have some skills that brings you money like programmer, designer etc."
p66
aS"No, they still cam easily earn 1 btc in a month.Faucet owners never go into loss, all the faucet money given ad earnings. They keep some percentage of money earned with and distribute the rest. Many, put on Anti ad blockers. Many use fixed rate static banner which are not blocked by ad blockers.But it's difficult to the faucets to gain users in a month or two. And again it would require web development skills."
p67
aS'1 btc is very hard to earn in just a month but if you can do multitask maybe you can earn it. Freelance,\xc2\xa0 data entry or captcha entry and some ptc are good for earning but i dont think its enough to make 1 btc in just a month. You can try also signature campaign here which gives you reward from advertising their signatures. But with that rank, not worth to do this.'
p68
aS'That is a impossible achievement. 1 BTC monthly working only two hours daily... To earn a big amount like that you should find a real job. Here on the internet you will be able to earn only extra income to help you in the end of month. Very few people make a real big amount of money on the internet to live. I suggest you to try save some money to make an investiment, on the internet or real life.'
p69
aS"It's really hard to make 1 bitcoin in a month or 2, but its still possible mission if you have really needed skills and goods to sell. Diversifying your methods to earn bitcoins will help to accomplish this mission faster."
p70
aS"You forgot about the middle sentences are mentioned by him, He was spending two hours for a day. And you may re-write your suggestion for that again. The possible things are PTC, and we should have forgotten about the signature campaign and captcha, it was taking more time for it. Except, He shouldn't have filled all of the posts every week."
p71
aS'You can start write in this forum and join a good signature campaign. It takes time, and you might be anxious for money, but, fast money don\'t tends to be "cool", I don\'t mind to people who ask about darknet and the "opportunities" it offers because it a huge temptation, but it so full of scammer that even the most respected markplaces are exploding with scammers. But, if you want some "trickies" there\'s the best place because here in the forum, people will only advise you to get a job, to sell goods, to write campaign.... You know, 2 hours is a lot of time, I can travel almost 1000km in 2h. '
p72
aS'Fiat? What is that about? Does is it a website?'
p73
aS'\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I started to earn bitcoins few months ago, until now I have collected 0.11 btc. That is for couple months, and I`m active maybe one hour per day maybe more. To earn 1 bitcoin or 2 bitcoins you need some special skill, programing, or maybe if you are some graphic designer then you can find some good paid job, for that you can check service section, I saw some very high offers.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Its possible to earn big money here, I read about it almost every day, just this people have skills and their find them selfs good positions. Now there is so many casinos, services, and new one also, you can find something if you know to do something.'
p74
aS"It is not even requiring a website or anything. Fiat is simply our cash money or paper money. So he means that work a job that will pay you fiat money.I hope this will enlighten you.That's amazing and inspiring it seems that you are very skillful in programming. Earning 0.11 BTC just for a couple of months.Hmm, maybe you should work for real job and get paid in bitcoin."
p75
aS'You can mine.Depends... Where you live, power cost, cooling cost (if any), equipment costs.'
p76
aS'of course you make 1 btc in 30 days...work for home ..search on facebook or teach languages  '
p77
aS'It is really an easy money haha, but guess what $20 varies to your looks as well.\xc2\xa0 $20 can be in a moderate face+body. If you are that ugly you cannot get that certain amount i guess.'
p78
aS"To earn big amount in quick time you should invest in altcoin.But since you don't want to invest then you need to have some skills like web designing, programming, developing etc.By these skills you can get many jobs on Freelancer website.Besides these you can also earn a decent amount by joining a signature campaign on this forum."
p79
aS'with a gun to a bank, ok,this is a joke,haha'
p80
aS'Its hard to earn without some money to invest in the first place. Probably you might end up in earning free faucet of little amount of btc but its hard to earn big at the end. You may earn big using your skills by joining here in forum as translator and other signature campaign. '
p81
aS'Lol, he is not looking for a way to go behind bars or to be killed, the way you said is probably the easiest way for that, if he wants to earn that amount without any investment he will surely need to work for it, whether offline or online, if he can work offline and convert the money to bitcoin it would be good too.'
p82
aS"You don't will earn nothing with signature campaigns, less yet with faucets...You can't find a lot of translactions to work on...And well, profiting in trade isn't that easy too"
p83
aS"And what is your definition? It seems like a lot of the things wasn't becoming a good thing for you.And if we haven't tried We haven't known the answer.A lot of translation job was providing in a lot of the kind."
p84
aS"I doubt if mining would be profitable unless the electricity costs are low, climate is cool, and you can bear the noise But as he said that wants to earn a Bitcoin \xc2\xa0in two months, mining won't be helpful. Mining would give you roi in a year or more .Instead, trading currencies would give you better returns. But if you don't want to waste your time daily, mining would pay you in long run and won't require much skill."
p85
aS'Yeah, I totally agree with you. something we want definitely should be in use by the hard work that we have to do, things will not be successful in this world without having the hard work and passion. Something big thing certainly has the hard work which is greater than the results they get. Take a look at The miliader virtual world as the owner of facebook and also a google or microsoft. They all became successful because of the hard work'
p86
aS'Do you know any site where someone can teach a language and earn some money for it? I would love to try this service is available.And OP, you should try your services by posting your thread in services section, besides that there isnt any working method of earning 1 bitcoin in one or two months without investments.'
p87
aS'LOL! Dude this is the craziest suggestion I have ever read here just to earn 1 bitcoin per month. It is not even enough for your life.So you want to suggest that every want you will rob a bank? This will just put you in jail.And dude, this is not even a good joke at all.'
p88
aS"Isn't so easy to find home works, maybe you can translate some altcoin announcement here and there but I doubt that you will earn 1 bitcoin in a month... And for you teach languages, you have to masterize 2 languages and I'm sure that's hard to find clients..."
p89
aS"The type of work you are finding is at upwork but actually its not easy to get some clients who wants to learn the service you offered since competitionis tight since there are many people waiting for that kind of job to grab on, and you must get good backgrounds and proper hard work to get that one so you can get the target money you wishing for but i don't think it will go to reach the 1 btc target, but if hardwork will be there well nothing trully impossible for the dream money target to get reached."
p90
aS'its really hard to get that certain amount in a month or two by doing it for a part time and without any investment, maybe you can try to offer your skills here if you have coding /programming skills might be possible to gain that with your hard work.'
p91
aS'Simply, you can meet your target if you do not invest. And you can not earn 1btc or 2btc a month if you would just spend your time in working on it for just 2 hours a day only, unless you invest or do trading.'
p92
aS'If we have time limit than should do hard work, if we earn 1 bitcoin within 1 or 2 months. Secondly, main thing is that your capital, if you have big capital, than definitely, no problem to complete 1 bitcoin, but if you have small amount to complete the 1 bitcoin, than definitely you need hard working, Also you know that earn money it is a difficult way, no easy just we think, when we started to earn than we know. But i suggest you, not need to ask anyone, only do hard working on that field which you think you have a skills. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0'
p93
aS'Just try hard to earn and grind bitcoins on many sites and here'
p94
aS"If anybody would be able to answer OP's question, I would definitely do it for hours every day. 1 bitcoin in a month for just 2 hours a day of work and no investment sounds like too good to be true to me. I think that's only possible if you do have a decent day job in a first world country. The best way to at least reach somewhere near that amount is to have an actual job. It's much harder to earn money online than to work in real life."
p95
aS"You are simply asking how to make 700 bucks in a month or two. The best shot you can have is to find a real job. Hit to the nearest mc Donald's and fill a job applying form. I am pretty sure you will be able to buy a Bitcoin in a month. If not, go with the plan b and buy it in 2 months!"
p96
aS"BTC1 is possible a month for just 2 hours a day but it's not on regular or fixed basis and that 2 hours doesn't mean 2 straight hours but rather 2 hours overall spent in a day. It's possible here in our country as a freelance programmer and web developer. I have a friend of mine who can do that and that BTC1 is not that big and possibility to earn that is possible.Back then when the bitcoin price is below $500, I can covered that BTC1 a month with my day job salary but now with the increase (around $700) I need at least another month more lol."
p97

p98
aS'if you want to produce one bitcoin quickly, you need a bitcoin is quite a lot for it, because every job quickly had things worth having. you may need about 1 BTC to produce 1 BTC in one or two months. you only need to invest in altcoin, or do you need to play trading. You can also collect 1 BTC in a very quick time to gamble, but it has a greater risk of the trade, but they also need capital to play'

aS'We all know developer and skilled users will make this easy, but i believe the question is for the general person, without any skill, just with a lot of free time. Besides we be able to buy bitcoin directly, even not all of us, we can earn a part of those bitcoins with signatures and some tasks.'
p100
aS'I agree technical skills need foundation and it will take years of learning.\xc2\xa0 For a regular person especially in my country, 1 Bitcoin per month is quite impossible if we talk about a regular employees pay rate.\xc2\xa0 It will take 2 and a half month of work to get a full bitcoin.\xc2\xa0 That is without deductions but with deduction it will take 3 months or more.'
p101
aS'Find a good job here on forum, gamble a lot like I do, trade, sell your ass for bitcoins, in my opinion its not the question how to make 1 btc per month, its question what you are ready to do for 1 btc? I gamble with money I earn here, and I had some nice wins for all this time here. Its not just wins, I lose a lot in trying. And that is all that man got to do, to try and try and never to quit. Its my way and I`m going good, in moments I type this comment I play poker. I`m thinking that key is in determination, find you way and work for that. Nobody will give you simple and easy solution for earning big money, you need to sacrifice yourself.'
p102
aS"I think the best thing you can do is to find a job either in your area or on this forum. Look for the Services section here, and you'll find people wanting someone to work for them. One Bitcoin in a month is impossible only with signature campaigns or so. Whatever you do, don't go for gambling because that means risking your hundreds. "
p103
aS'Nope, even in signature campaign also you could not earn 1 btc or more that. I think campaign managers and the programmers involved in the bitcoin projects only able to achieve that according to my guess. Any campaign could answer on this.'
p104
aS'You can make money by investing : time, talent, and many other things'
p105
aS"If you don't have any marketable skills, or products\xc2\xa0 and since you don't have money to invest then earning that amount of money is going to be very difficult since the only other ways left are signature campaigns and faucets."
p106
aS'Trading and signature campaigns can really help you without any doubts, the only thing is that you need to stay doing it and it will almost be a full time job..'
p107
aS'You have to look for opportunities. There are opportunities where you can earn 1 btc even in 2 days without any investment I remember, CryptoSky earned 75 Bitcoin equivalent in 2 months for translating and moderation Iconomi Russian thread.Also, you could have earned a Bitcoin in one or two days in Iconomi Bounty. One high quality article on Iconomi was paid Bounty which is equivalent to not than a Bitcoin.You can easily write an article in two. It would take around 10 hours to complete an article.So, rightly said that in cryto world there is no discrimination. Even a person from a poor country, of any gender, any age could earn.CryptoSky hopefully would own about \xc2\xa0100 Bitcoin equivalent the end this year. (ICN token value is increasing day by day). Which would be equivalent to $70,000\xc2\xa0 '
p108
aS'The only way to earn such an amount of bitcoins is either selling products or selling technical services as OP mentioned he does not have anything to invest so there is no other option for him, if he chooses to earn that amount by a signature campaign or faucets he would probably not be able to achieve his target in just 2 months for sure.'
p109
aS"It is hard to make 1 bitcoin in a month if you do not have any special skill or degree. If you have some these factors, you can apply for a bitcoin-related job online and start working for the salary. If you don't, trading and gambling can be very efficient. However, they contain a lot of risks. "
p110
aS'Bitcoin or two is a prety large sum of money. In fact having in mind current price Bitcoin is average monthly salary in my country.It will be hard to earn so much coins here on forum. Maybe if you have some special skills that are paying good but you will probably have to work as much hard and long as if you have some regular job. Good luck!'
p111
aS'if you have some skills many people desire like web developer, mobile apps or ios apps developer, or you can make apps of smartphone or ios etc, I think you can earn 1 bitcoin even more in short time.you can go herehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=98555there are a lot of job websites there, just pick one by one and look for a job even more you can do in your spare time.'
p112
aS'That is just happen at the large ico project, and it is depending on your luck, dude. Just one from a lot of the time. And the correct username is skyrik.'
p113
aS'But if he had the opportunity to do technical job or offer products to the community then he will not need to ask since you can make money with those skills or products almost everywhere, so it is very likely that he cannot do that.'
p114
aS"The price is climbing up, that means earning bitcoin is getting harder too, that's for sure, even if you have skills, it would still take time to make 2 bitcoin, 1 bitcoin is possible, however, you may earn it now or the next month you won't if you are going to use your skill since you are not just the only one in the market that wants to promote it for sure. Except if you are the pioneer."
p115
aS"Yes, it is your luck. But, I could easily understand that Iconomi would be great. I too wrote an article, got around 0.6 Bitcoin equivalent Every other month, there are many icos running, many of them are scam, many don't reach threshold. Important thing is reading their white paper. Now, I think ARK too would be great. Read their white paper, their smartbridge technology is really the first to introduced and very innovative.You at talking about luck. But the white crypto world based on luck. Anything could happen. You can see a crypto even gain or lose 200% in a matter of days.Actually Skyrik is only CryptoSky ( on Twitter @cryptosky)"
p116
aS'The best way is to try freelancing jobs but it depends on what skill you have/What you can do.Here are some sites you can try, They pay bitcoin. 1. https://www.xbtfreelancer.com2). /r/Jobs4bitcoin \xc2\xa0(Reddit)3). https://coinality.comOr you can try on upwork or fiverr. \xc2\xa0They also have simple jobs. Some advice, Your two hours a day is not enough to make a 1 bitcoin in just 2-3 months. It is much better to just focus on your job than freelancing on some sites.\xc2\xa0 Because you can just buy some bitcoins using your salary and keep it for investment. '
p117
aS'By freelance jobs or selling services someone might earn some bitcoins with the time but as OP mentioned that he can just dedicate 2 hours of his time for that then it is probably not possible for him, and by that he seems to be looking for quick money or he might think earning bitcoins is easy which is not true.'
p118
aS'Without any skills of coding its very hard to make such ammount, but you can start with a small ammount and try sporting bets as well forex, both may lead you achieve those ammount, but there is a huge risk to loose trying to achieve.'
p119
aS'Yes, ofcourse, in freelancing sites you can earn 1 btc a month. If you have a hidden skills that need by the client you should use it. But it is a competition of many freelancer like you, you should take a bid in a lowest payment to get big chances to pick you up by the client.'
p120
aS"Without investment it's difficult to earn 1bitcoin in One month.You should have some skills to earn bitcoin.Youu need to have skills like web design, Android development, C Programming etc.You can search these job on freelance website.These website can give you many works just choose and get start "
p121
aS'very strange question. but you have no even the minimum investment? participation in new ICO is good way for doubling your money. but you need at least some money, try it, i think it is interesting. a lot of good ico were at this mounth, also some new will soon. '
p122
aS"It would really depends on\xc2\xa0 you\xc2\xa0 experience and skills too. The\xc2\xa0 most\xc2\xa0 hard thing\xc2\xa0 in the\xc2\xa0 first place is\xc2\xa0 on\xc2\xa0 how\xc2\xa0 people\xc2\xa0 would\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0trust you\xc2\xa0 hence\xc2\xa0 you are\xc2\xa0 just starting\xc2\xa0 and don't\xc2\xa0 have enough\xc2\xa0 reputation people\xc2\xa0 will surely\xc2\xa0 choose\xc2\xa0 the\xc2\xa0 most\xc2\xa0 experienced\xc2\xa0 users than\xc2\xa0 you that's why\xc2\xa0 its\xc2\xa0 hard\xc2\xa0 but\xc2\xa0 if\xc2\xa0 someone\xc2\xa0 recognizes your works and projects\xc2\xa0 then\xc2\xa0 people would really recognize\xc2\xa0 you and\xc2\xa0 popularity\xc2\xa0 would\xc2\xa0 surely arise and earning money\xc2\xa0 is\xc2\xa0 not\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0a problem anymore."
p123
aS'Well you cant even earn 1 BTC via Faucets\xc2\xa0 in 6 months also. I think you should first see what service can you provide and then charge Bitcoins for that service. In this way you can earn Good money in the form of bitcoins'
p124
aS'Well if you have more knowledge regarding to some business you can try do some buy and sell service invest your bitcoin with product that very usable in your place and accept bitcoin as mode of payment better way to earn and grow bitcoin.'
p125
aS"ICO's are good way to earn but you may need to look for ICO's that has good developments and road map. So mostly, you will full time to join ICO's that are coming out in able to earn 1 bitcoin monthly. BUt I would say, that not all the time ICO's are good way to earn bitcoins. Because there are ICO's also that are just scams."
p126
aS"There are times when an ICO is a good investment and people seems to just remember that part. They don't remember when an ICO's dev just leave the project or maybe they just haven't experienced that yet. Nevertheless, it would really be good to be fully committed in the project and not just invest then leave. You should always keep on the news about the coin, check how it is frequently, and even promote it to your bitcoin user friends to gain some more audience. No matter how you do, you shouldn't just leave all the work to the ICOs team. You should do your part too as an investor."
p127
aS'you just need to focus on your work. you can trade bitcoin or altcoin. there I am sure that the work can bring you a lot of bitcoin. focus, then everything you want as you can.'
p128
aS'This is the best way to make 1 bitcoin or even higher for working seriously to your full time job. And you can also demand some over time work to make this possible to happen. And trading will be another great platform in able to reach this goal of earning 1 - 2 bitcoins monthly. But you need to work double time for this amount.'
p129
aS"Yes that is what we need to do if we are going to do join ICO's and aiming to earn good profit with it. Knowing what is the current news for them and let's assume if our investment is becoming worth to them. And what you are saying to be part of the project is really needed. That is what we called cooperation, if you cooperate to make the project successful then help them and in return the project will give you both good profit and it can be even higher than 1- 2 bitcoins monthly that you are hoping."
p130
aS'If a person is acquiring an exceptional skills on crypto or in cyberworld, 1 bitcoin is just a piece of crap to earn. The best example here is the ICO or crowdfunding, if you have some brilliant idea about crypto, then do some coin and present to all what is specification of it.\xc2\xa0 Then let people fund your works and earn some bucks easily. I hoped acquired that knowledge too. '
p131
aS'Yes this skills would really give you decent amounts of money hence this kind of skills is really an edge to everybody. If you are a\xc2\xa0 developer or creator a certain coin which\xc2\xa0 do have unique features compared to other coins then maybe\xc2\xa0 you could able to get big investors then 1 to 2 btc is like a dust actually but sadly we dont have these kind of skills. We are hoping the same thing too. '
p132
aS'ICO can be a really fast way of investment and earning but unfortunate you wont find many legal ICO and most of the time your investment will end up in losing. but if you find the Good ICO, it will be best thing u have.'
p133
aS"Finding Good ICO's is not an easy thing to do\xc2\xa0 because\xc2\xa0 there are\xc2\xa0 lots of\xc2\xa0 coins to choose from and\xc2\xa0 its hard to know\xc2\xa0 if its a\xc2\xa0 potential coin or not and some are just show offs\xc2\xa0 just to get\xc2\xa0 big investors. On my\xc2\xa0 side I wont\xc2\xa0 bother\xc2\xa0 to put money on\xc2\xa0 any ICO since ive been scammed\xc2\xa0 previously which is really a sad thing happened to me and I lost huge amounts of bitcoin\xc2\xa0 and that's was my mistake and ive learned from it. Better to focus on your skills and services."
p134
aS'dont have any problems with scammed ico yet, thanks god. For example some days ago it was ROUND ico. price went up to 20x ico. but it looks like a real scam at the start. As for me i look all ICOs at cyber.fund. Also soon it will be gnosis and filecoin ICO. i really hope for them.'
p135
aS'If i do have kind of skills i will sure work offline and online\xc2\xa0 because i\xc2\xa0 know that earning bitcoin or fiat money will be decent enough.You are right salary would really be big compare to those ordinary jobs which is not related to programming and developing.Earning 2 bitcoins is really possible but for those people only have skills but for those people have only average skills we should not let our selves down because theres a lot of oppotunities to make money.'
p136
aS'You can try gambing'
p137
aS"Yes, he can try gambling, but... It's more probably he will lose 1-2 bitcoins monthly (or more) than win. Gambling isn't a safe way to make profit, the chance to lose all the money is higher than the chance to win. Only few lucky players get the jackpot and make a lot of cash, but sooner or later they will back to the casino, continue betting and will lose a lot of money."
p138
aS"Yup, a gambling is not one of the best ways to do. Because in the gambling will only make us be someone who can't think well after we get addicted in gambling, I am not saying that gambling is bad. But gambling is a place that can change your way of looking into a little messed up because of a different mind of mindset. so avoid gambling if it doesn't want to get a risk"
p139
aS"If you have a lot of skills to offer then it will possible but if you don't just focus on your work in real life as it will be impossible to earn a bitcoin per month .\xc2\xa0 And some advise,\xc2\xa0 Your two hours is not enough . Most bitcoin users know that earning bitcoin is just like a part time job and it will be not wise to make it as a main source of income . All we can do now is wait for bitcoin to be fully adopted cause it will surely bring more opportunities to us . "
p140
aS'I see no description of skills and no country is indicated. A real mistery and not enough information for suggesting to him something with this conditions.'
p141
aS'Do You call $10 or $20 at Day as Big Money?For "Making Nothing" is not bad, this is true.I sospect, that this dude have at least some English skills and use internet.For the start is not Bad.But we have no other info about him.'
p142
aS'The real help could be given only with more about him.Might be he live in exotic place or he have some skills.I see he is scared by comments.'
p143
aS"It is impossible even for Legendary members here to earn that amount unless you have some extremely special and extraordinary skills that you would like to showcase and you might get a good offer for the same. But I don't think you will get it so easily giving just 2 hours, earning bitcoins take a lot and what you are asking is a big amount."
p144
aS"It's possible. I earn even more. But it's absolutely not effortless , agree with you."
p145
aS"If you have capital to start for. You cantry gambling or trading it's possible to earn it there but it's too risky too and need high capital. But without capital no it's not possible you can earn it but it takes more time to have it."
p146
aS"Your thinking is absolutely correct. But I would not agree and would not believe against gambling because gambling is a very dangerous thing for those who do not control their emotions or passions. Without the close control all it brings is very bad and can undermine their economies. So better use trading compared gambling if you don't have a really good. But it's all too dependent on you all"
p147
aS'without skills, we can not earn money, even if we only has a little skills, i am sure that we can make a few bucks in daily. but it will be better if we have skills, any skill, because it can help us to make more money than we can think. the list of option you mention is a good start but it needs to stay focus and continue for a middle time before you can get much of money.'
p148
aS"That's why it would be much better if you spend a lot of time sharpening your saw than to use your dull saw right away and spend all your time sawing a tree. One thing that I've noticed in the world, you get paid depending on your skill. If you have no skill or knowledge, then you don't have the rights to rant about not getting the amount of salary that you want. If everyone can do what you're doing, you can easily be replaced. The type of person that you are isn't scarce.Skillful people, on the other hand, gets paid a lot, like.. a lot. They spent their time enhancing their skills, beating the person they were yesterday, and that's how they got into where they are right now. "
p149
aS'You are with some project in hands thats why you saying its possible to achieve such ammount, becaude even doing all the tasks here daily, joining signatures, wont allow to make such ammount, sure if you have some product you can try to sell it here but even with that way i dont believe you will be able to reach 1 bitcoin, and if you do you wont share the key to achieve it.'
p150
aS'Use your brain, you will see how easy you can make more than 1btc in a month, 1btc is nothing if you know what you are doing. Lots of great opportunities'
p151
aS'Trading can be an option but you can also just do some signature campaigns to gain such an amount, you than of course need a good one but its possible.'
p152
aS'There are ways to earn money with no skills.But we have little info about topic starter.'
p153
aS"Yes, if he is a professional that has a license for sure that 1-2 bitcoins he is aiming will be just nothing compare to their salary. But it seems that he doesn't any license but maybe drivers license only. By doing both it can be helpful but if he is not that knowledgeable in trading he needs to study first.I guess he is not scared to comment maybe he is just having some holidays or he is in vacation or experiencing some internet and power interruption and not able to reply to this thread."
p154
aS'If this dude is living in a exotic place he is advantaged as video bloger.'
p155
aS'There could be lots of ways to achieve what you want maybe or may not be but here in this forum you may earn some btc and for that go to service section of this forum and take a look at the offers posted there by other members or join a signature campaign :-)'
p156
aS'For example, anyone have the possibility to make video presentations or text reading on the camera.'
p157
aS'If op is not skilled person he will have hard time to get those services offered on that section because he is aiming too much.That 1 bitcoin is already a salary here in my country for a mid level professionals so if he is just asking it to get throughout the web.For sure he will have hard time nailing it.'
p158
aS"If OP will join signature campaign and concentrate on it, he can't use his skills anymore to earn more, or if he concentrate on his skills to earn, for sure he cannot do full time in signature campaign. He will cram with time and I think if you want to earn 1 bitcoin a month, time will be very important. Giveaways and other small tasks in the services section won't be enough to earn 1 bitcoin a month."
p159
aS'Yes, signature campaign alone will not enough to earn one bitcoins in one month as typical campaign payments as per current trend would be ~0.03 BTC for a week so it might take 34 weeks to reach one full bitcoins. But with other skill and luck we may get chances to earn from services and games and round giveaways. But, will not be consistent.'
p160
aS'Legendary accounts need 3-4 years to achieved and its not easy to build one. lol.\xc2\xa0 Having 20 Legendary accounts will surely make you 1 bitcoin a month. What do you think? haha.\xc2\xa0 Back to topic, if youdont have enough time to focus on online world better to focus on investing offline.'
p161
aS'At present, it is next to impossible to make 1 btc without any capital to invest into trading. I am not going to talk about gambling and win 1 btc. '
p162
aS"I don't know what's the average hourly payment in your country, but I think that by having a simple part-time job and by buying bitcoins with some of your earnings making a bitcoin every two months would be quite simple."
p163
aS'Best answer is: Get a real job! Because nobody will give you free money (or free btc) it\'s just "crazy". And 1 btc (or 2  ) are a good amount that could help also for a decent living. There is any sure method, if you have a ranked account you can earn up to 0,1 btc each month (so far) writing in the forum and using signature campaign. But also it\'s not a safe method, they can change the payment rate, close their service, ban for spam etc etc etc...'
p164
aS'Real life job would suffice if your goal is 1 bitcoin a month, unfortunately there are places and jobs that offer lower salary, which means, even if you have a day job, you will still fall short to have a bitcoin in a month and if you did buy one bitcoin, well, you would not eat.\xc2\xa0  Along with day job, it is necessary to have atleast 2 or more side jobs if you are aiming to atleast afford 1 bitcoin in a month.'
p165
aS"However, signature campaigns should not be one's primary goal of being here. You should be promoting Bitcoin apart from the forum, helping newcomers and pushing towards global adoption. Like others have said, the amount of time spent posting just to get a minute amount of Bitcoin is an extreme waste of time, and you are much better off converting money earned at a job to Bitcoin instead."
p166
aS"Its the same always.Believe me its hard to earn money itself and it won't come for the amount of work ur ready to do.U'll need to work hard and do various things together like mining,online jobs and signature campaigns to maybe earn 1 btc at most which too is tentative and very hard believe me I tried doing this before.   "
p167
aS'You have a point sir. And based on what i observe in this forum, signature campaign is the hottest topic here even the DT is all focus on it, scammer nowadays is just a stranger on this forum. For me, Services that involves skills is much profitable here better than posting for just a penny. There is no such rules that giving parameters to the freedom of our post.\xc2\xa0 '
p168
aS'Of course, absolutely I don\'t want promote signature campaign as a way to earn btc for "free". Also there is an high risk to spam in the forum due low quality post and this is a big problem.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just tell a way to earn some btc without using "fake" method like faucet, "investments" and so... and meanwhile help other users.Normally I try to share info about btc with friends and coworker, an activity not remunerated\xc2\xa0  , but I hope also a global adoption of btc currency/technology related. '
p169
aS"Everything it does is right. But it also depends on what the campaign wanted sign and certainly I'm sure sign campaing have criteria someone who can follow the sign campaign. So you need not worry that all that it can lead to spam, if it be considered spam for sure Automation they will not be accepted by the sign campaign. Investment is very good but it is also at risk if you don't know their knowledge well"
p170
aS'Trade dude \xc2\xa0buy and sell things . Find a need and fill it. Trade in anything it doesnt matter what. Altcoin trading is quite cool too. Let the money work for you not you for the money. Find a gap and a need and fill that. Noone here is going to tell you how to make money that is entirely up to you. We can only point you in the right direction but ultimately its all up to you. '
p171
aS"It will be hard for him if he doesn't have something for trading because he is looking for something that has without investment. But I guess he should understand first that it is very impossible to generate 1-2 BTC without investment or else he is looking for some job titles can will pay him that amount in return of his hard work."
p172
aS"Of course it is, signature campaigns are only a particular percentage here because this forum made to discuss topics about bitcoins and other news in the world. But signature are the trending topic here as all mod are aware and keeping the forum from signature spammers.To @OP accept the truth that its too hard to earn money, you can't make money with that huge amount in just a month or two months. Except if you are already a big time business man 1 bitcoin for two months is really easy but if you are just like me from a third world country that wants to earn online and to help my family regarding financial even just here then 2 months is really impossible."
p173
aS'maybe you can start with visitbit idk where the link'
p174
aS'participating on signature campaign is not a relying job online to earn bitcoin its just an temporary earning so we should not rely on that and also we cant \xc2\xa0earn 1 bitcoin in a month or 2 because earning on signature campaigns are just few amounts.'
p175
aS'Well you can earn money without investing through sig campaign but earning 1 or 2 btc is not possible for a month to earn even if you have a high rank. in trading you can earn good amount but sadly you dont have capital to start with.'
p176
aS"Even if you are a legendary rank, You can't earn an amount of money from signature campaign that is greater than your job in real life but it is enough to earn some extra cash .Since I have my job in the real world,\xc2\xa0 My time to spend here is very limited so I am not hoping to earn some huge bucks in bitcoin .\xc2\xa0 But I am thankful that bitcoin lets me earn extra cash that I can add to my monthly salary .And yes earning that huge amount of bitcoin in a month is impossible so it will be best to just continue your job in real life . Just accept the fact that you can only earn some extra cash in bitcoin "
p177
aS'Earning with that amount is not a joke and it needs to be some professional portfolio in able to reach that amount you are expecting monthly. It is also possible if you are an online businessman which your goods are high quality and it is on demand. Like by selling digital goods, vip memberships for a particular sites.And also by selling physical goods like gadgets which is definitely in demand.'
p178
aS"Having 30 Legendary accounts would work even betterThere seems to be around that number of currently active signature campaigns, and most of them require 30-50 posts a week (i.e. 4-7 posts a day). Provided you post substance and can make about 150 posts a day on a regular basis, which is not totally unfeasible if you are fluent in English and can devote all your time to that task. If we take an average pay of 0.0007 BTC per post, that will give us 30x150x0.0007=3.15 BTC of monthly income which is potentially achievable through participation in signature campaigns. I don't consider enrolling two (or more, lol) accounts in one campaign since that would be against all rules, for obvious reasons"
p179
aS"How do people can handle this number of post everyday and number of accounts even just 1 account is so hard to earn because of you can't write a well posts in any sections of this forum so how about the 29 remaining account if you have that number, well then if you have that amount of accounts you will not reach the legendary rank because you will be ban of this so many alts in an early rank."
p180
aS"I don't know since I don't have 30 Legendary accounts (or any accounts, for that matter). I was simply evaluating how much you could potentially earn through signature campaigns without breaking rules. Though I don't know either how having 30 accounts is not against rules itself since that should be considered as account farming. On the other hand, if all 30 alts of you don't post crap, you should be okay. Further, if you get engaged in hot debates over something in a few parts of the forum, you could actually reach and touch that many daily posts without constantly counting them. I personally know some guys who got there (but I'm certainly not one of them)...And they know that too"
p181
aS'Its way too risky. Perhaps the OP can do some signature job or other tasks which he is skilled at. If he is not skilled enough, he should work to develop skills that he can sell and earn bitcoin.'
p182
aS'Lets see bitcoin is at around 700+ dollars range when I am writing this , which means OP wants to make 700$ to 1400$ , he can make bitcoins EXACTLY like you can make 700$ to 1400$ as well. Wanna sell a service? Any can do . Wanna sell a product? Yes! . Every way we make dollars , we can make bitcoins.'
p183
aS'Only if OP is going to be a hardworking like those people who are killing themselves by working hard just to reach their aim.And with this amount, op can simply just look for some real job in his home town and work their quietly.If he is skilled, then this amount is an easy number for him especially if he is a degree holder.'
p184
aS'You don\'t have to work so hard that you physically/mentally killing yourself. You can always work smart. You can buy and sell things IRL but buy it in wholesale so you can get it for extra low amount and then sell them in the price that people usually buy. This way, your profit is large. But even so, it\'s still hard to earn 1 bitcoin or 2 in just a month. I would still suggest looking for a day job. If you did listen to those "motivational" speech saying that college isn\'t important, well, today\'s the day you can start regretting not going to college. A degree is really important when looking for a job.'
p185
aS'YOu will really have a hard time when you dont finished college in those years because having a degree is just a basic requirement and if you dont meet that requirement then you are rejected directly without any questions.No education means less competence but there are some people who didnt finish college but\xc2\xa0 could able to manage themselves to support and earn money to make living.'
p186
aS'Xenophoto your suggestion is also near to the strategy of leveraging in buying and selling. You will buy things at low price and sell it higher.But that is going to be more effective if you are going to employ some people likely 5-10 people for selling your stuffs.And while he has his own job, this business is going to keep on going and that will make 1-2 bitcoins monthly.'
p187
aS'If I remember correctly, Bill Gates had dropped out of Harvard University because he seemed to be more occupied with making money than studying back then. It turned out to be a right decision in the end. And then he just bought that Harvard degree for 20M dollars, though they themselves claim that it was their initiative to have it handed to him...As some Harvard professor pompously declared:The lesson to take home is that when money talks bullshit walks'
p188
aS'If you have skills in trading i think you can earn it within a month or 2 or if you have a good script that will work on some online gambling then it will be pretty easy to earn a bitcoin all you have to do is have a capital to start earning.'
p189
aS"Gambling is risky method and not guaranteed , i don't think its good way to make btc easily and fast. Trading is more safe, but there is some experience and knowledge requested before starting with this domain, otherwise its as risky as gambling.I prefer selling goods and services online for Bitcoin, as its safe and without risks involved."
p190
aS'I cant think a job that can make you earn money without investment.but i have suggestions why not doing online jobs,or solving captchas,doing task on service section in exchange of bitcoin.'
p191
aS"If Op got 12 hands and start to do all this jobs even after doing for 30 days he can not make 1 Bitcoin. Making 1 Bitcoin is hard but if you have any special skill than it is possible to earn 1 Bitcoin per month.It's never that easy to earn money online."
p192
aS'Why not dedicate that 2 hours in searching for a nice job,rather than doing nothing in front of your computer. Having a work is one of the main factor to earn money. Why not try to be a gasoline boy.'
p193
aS'As quoted in the above quote trying and finding a day job is the best way to make a good earning equal to 1 bitcoin. Then with that can make regular investment in the form of bitcoin to get some additional earnings.'
p194
aS'Go and find a decent job dont rely on bitcoin to help you. Why not use that 2 hours of time finding a job. You\xc2\xa0 think you can earn 10 usd a day sitting and online for two hours. It would.be better that you find a real job to have a salary every month.'
p195
aS"How can it be possible to happen if op is not replying to this thread on what is his situation now, if he's employed with real job or online job.But yes, that's the best thing to do is to find some decent job in able to sustain his goal to earn 1 bitcoin for a month.And better to aim 1 bitcoin a month rather than to aim for 2 bitcoin."
p196
aS"There is only one issue. Most people here don't have jobs or decent jobs offers on their area, that is why they are here, trying to earning pennies to earn some extra income monthly. Surely that find a job is the best thing to do, but unfortunelly it's not available for everyone.The best thing to do is to get each penny you earn on this forum offers, save all your money and try to double it in a smart way (making a investment, it can be in real life). Buy things that people would buy in your area, resell it, make profit, do it again. Work as an animal breeder at home is a good option also."
p197
aS"Also having some investments while having your regular job because we can't assure that your job will be able to get paid with the amount you are hoping as 1 bitcoin up to 2 bitcoins monthly. The more source of income you will have, then that is going make your goal to be more possible to happen."
p198
aS'Simplefx or Sport bet !!'
p199
aS"I assume that you're suggesting to do gambling on those website. I do not recommend gambling as a way to earn money. People have tried doing that ever since and most of them just continuously fails to earn money from it. Gambling just makes people lose even more money. Sure, you can get that amount of money out of gambling. That really is a possibility but it does have a really low likelihood."
p200
aS"I guess that is going to be a hard way if he is going to utilize facebook and twitter and aims to earn 1 bitcoin for a month. Maybe he should really find a real job and get paid for his works and employment to the company. Because for a newbie who is asking too much profit that doesn't have clarity about his skills and talents is hard to give suggestions."
p201
aS'Agree with this, that newbie need to learn many things here to earn more but it is so impossible to earn 1 btc in 1 to 2 months time .'
p202
aS'Yes one month is very less. even if you are in high rank in the campaign so to gather the amount needed you have to involve yourself to some freelance activity.'
p203
aS'Do multiple task can earn 1 btc in one month or less depends how you are doing hard work.. If you can be a multi tasker you can earn 1 btc in one month offer your skills in services section selling in digital goods joining signature campaign.Also offer a translator in some altcoin those can help you earn massive bitcoin..\xc2\xa0 that i am sure you can earn it in 1 month not only those task you can also go to outside of this forum many company are paying in bitcoin. unlike before..'
p204
aS'1 bitcoin can be made by doing signature campaigns here on the forum if you are having a good rank and also a good campaign it can be done easily.'
p205
aS'But not all the time signature campaigns are there. It is better if you are going to look for some other sources too. Just like putting your earnings into trading or other profitable and legit way of investing. You can also include that investing into the bankroll of gambling sites are profitable but this is possible to reach that 1-2 bitcoin if you have big capital.'
p206
aS'Yes you are right, it may be better to get one bitcoin not only from one source. We must try other sources in addition to the signature campaign such as trade, services, investment, etc. It will facilitate us to get one bitcoin in a month or two months. I think if only the signature campaign despite high ratings it would not be enough to get one bitcoin.'
p207
aS"Signature campaign is not enough for making 1bitcoin in a month.Even Legendary member could earn\xc2\xa0 maximum 0.2 btc per month.We can do trading or altcoin investment to reach 1btc in a month.We can also open a lending service to earn more.Only signature campaign won't give you 1 btc."
p208
aS'I agree to you, Its hard to make 1 btc in just 1 month by just earning in signature campaign. In gambling or trading you can earn 1 btc in less than a month depending on your strategy on gambling or trading. '
p209
aS'Yes signature campaign can be not the way to earn 1 btc in a month but it can be one of the ways yo earn it.\xc2\xa0 So what I mean is to do multitasking,\xc2\xa0 Pick at least three ways that you can handle and start calcuting your income, Its better to make a plan or your schedule to make sure that you will earn it. Trading is good but you should avoid gambling because it is to risky you might lose your whole capital.\xc2\xa0 Gambling is not a way to earn just use it for entertainment. '
p210
aS'In gambling it would totally depend on your luck if you will earn more than 1 bitcoin before a month or you will lose more than that, but in trading it would more depend on your capital and strategy as in trading the profit you can earn depends on your capital.'
p211
aS'You can sell ebook, related to something about crypto, with those you can maybe reach those, being legendary here will allow you to get around 0,40btc, if you are a trusted person you can try signature manager, there are few people doing this and with 3-5 signatures its almost sure you will get atleast 1 btc, but for trusted people.'
p212
aS'u can dedicate ur hard work to freelance websites who are giving away bitcoins if u are working for them .otherwise by saving a little bit of money u can invest them in buying a miner which will give a lot of bitcoins even if u do not dedicate 2 hours a day .'
p213
aS'One of the viable ways I have seen that can get you to 1+ BTC is trading though you need strict principles to avoid being scammed as a first entry trader or you can try joining gambling competitions which pay its top players(use money to make money\xc2\xa0 )'
p214
aS'Correct, but by setting time frames you not only will be able to get your goals of earning bitcoin but in fact with hard work and endurance you could get almost any goal that you set yourself to get.'
p215
aS'It is not possible that you give only two hours per day and do not invest any thing and want to earn 1 bitcoin per day. for earning 1 bitcoin per month you need to give about 8 hours per day to work for different online services available on different places or you have to invest a good amount to have an income of 1 bitcoin per month.'
p216
aS'Yes indeed impossible to collect one bitcoin within one or two months, and therefore I was also told to try another source other than the signature campaign in order to collect the bitcoin within one or two months. If we try more than one source that will simplify and accelerate to get one bitcoin.'
p217
aS'If you do not want to invest your money and want to earn 1 or 2 bitcoins per month then you will have to learn some special skills to start work like you have to learn about designing websites or programming if you want simple work then learn at least the designing of advertising banners and signatures for this forum or logos for websites etc.'
p218
aS"Yeah, that's the easiest way to do. Because by having special skills then we would get a job and a good thought, because it all depends on our thoughts and desires. And also to be able to get 1 ++ btc then we also have to work hard, without hard work then it all just a dream and it just will we can get or feel in a dream world.Indeed it all started from a dream, but if we don't have the passion to make it happen then it will only make us lazy to work or we don't have a good spirit"
p219
aS'While having marketable skills is important, is also important to know what skills are in high demand and with low competition, designing banners and signatures for this forum is something in my opinion there is a lot of competition and there are already some members with very good reputation about it, so I think is better to find something else.'
p220
aS"It's Exactly like Programming/Coding. Learning that skill is no longer useful as a newcomer, there are a lot of professionals and a very fierce comeption amongst them. Programming, Graphics designing, web designing, freelancing, writing, translation ...etc have all become very hard for a newcomer to begin with and start earning with them.Also, I think trading would be risky for a newcomer but has the potentials to adopt more and more comers in the field with no problem. With hard work, most of things would be easy as pie."
p221
aS'Gambling will not be a good choice. Trading is a quite good as well as risky without proper skills. 1 BTC in a month is not impossible but yes it is tough. Doing various jobs and accepting Bitcoin will be a good help. But again lots of skills are required to complete.'
p222
aS'Very hard earn 1 btc in 2016 '
p223
aS"Of course it is, especially if you're just doing nothing then it will too hard, but if you started already even just claiming faucets, even just a small amount you'll earn. Then do quality post here and join any signature campaign that suits to your rank then it will be easy to earn. Just visit the service section there are tasks that you can earn also even just pennys."
p224
aS"Even in real life, earning with this value of fiat is not an easy thing to do. You need to put full efforts and time for it and that's going to be your reward.So if you are saying that earning 1 bitcoin for 2016 is hard, then encourage yourself that the difficulty will be lessen for next year.Only if, you are going to work harder for it."
p225
aS'Its either on online or offline world earning 1 btc a month would be really hard unless if you have an investment which would generate you income on that but if we are relying fully on hard work then we will really need to exert efforts in able to obtain this amount. Theres no difference at all and we should not really think that earning bitcoin is easy compared on physical work.'
p226
aS'Hard is something that can make the word atua respond our brains to work is not the maximum. Do you think that the btc to get 1 can only be obtained in investment ... /? . As good as any investment we get will definitely have a high level of risk. The investment is not be be getting 1 bTC, so another way to have the same potential and our task only with the excited and always work hard. Because a desire if not done with hard work, perseverance, and thinking that will completely end in ugliness'
p227
aS'Its hard to earn 1 bitcoin in a month or 2. It takes a lotof patience and determination. To achieve this earnings,you need to join an investment that surely gives an income.Therefore, this is not an easy thing to achieved, takes a lotof effort and wise investment.'
p228
aS"2 BTC a month is insanely simple.1. Get educated2. get a job3. buy btc every monthCome on guys this isn't rocket science. Or are you NEETs wanting to earn some bux while staying in your mom's basement?"
p229
aS"You don't need to join an investment, what you need to do is make your own initiative and get to know more about yourself.Try to market your own ideas and skills, for sure you will going to get some good profit out of it. And this amount of profit is not going to be sustained by just one source of income.You need to have a lot of it, selling of physical/digital goods, skills and all the things that can add to your profit."
p230
aS'without investment you can get much bitcoin but you must have skillwith skill you can open service selling, content writer, blogger, viewer youtuber, get traffic siteall about digital good sellingwithout skill, without investment very dificult and imposible you can get much bitcoin'
p231
aS'While earning a lot of money with faucets and signature campaigns is not possible, we need to start somewhere and those two are some of the easiest ways to get some additional bitcoin in your wallet, then you can use that as seed money for other projects.'
p232
aS'Without any skills you are unlikely to be able to earn a btc a month, 2 hours a day over 28, 56 hours would be an average wage where i am.if it is the same for you then get a job and buy btc.'
p233
aS'You can do some trading what is nice to do and also profitable or just do some signature campaigns that can also be done easily and is profitable without any risk at all for sure.'
p234
aS'Pretty speculation buddy, As you said we need more skills in crypto programming or trading skills to have 1 or more bitcoin in every month. If you want find easier way means you need to go with gambling. There is no easy option apart from this to 1 and more bitcoin a month.'
p235
aS'Trading, it is good but if we want to earn fast and big amount, than should do big investment. But if we have limited amount to do trading, than definitely it is impossible to earn 1 bitcoin in a month, even we do trading or something other work.But as he is asking for us, than i want to suggest to play gambling, because gambling is really helpful, when we earn big and in a short time.\xc2\xa0 '
p236
aS'yep thats right, gambling is last chance to get easy money with big amount profit but remember gambling is very risk because its also easy to lose, i prefers trading looking market which altcoin have good profit and doing fast trading , i mean place your Ask and Bid to get profit dont hold too long'
p237
aS"The op stated he did not have any money and that he was broke so investing any money is not possible for him right now, but joining giveaways may be an option although I have never participated in one so I don't know how much you could earn through it."
p238
aS'Agree,collecting amounts on giveaways arent enough to reach out 1 to 2 bitcoin per month they are just like an older brother of faucets which only gives you a small amounts of satoshis.Yes,it do really require work in able to make few satoshis but its not worth on your time and effort.'
p239
aS'No, gambling is not helpful if you are going to aim for your own profit. Gambling is only helpful if you have already that 1-2 bitcoins in your pocket.But hoping to earn with that amount in gambling is certainly absurd, better to have a legit way of earning like relying on your salary.'
p240
aS'It is very risky to enter into bitcoin exchange market if you are new. I have seen the HYIP and FUD from members. There are tons of shit coins. No one can predict what will come next. A new one may get very quick and high profit as well as great loss. And as a new comer in crypto, it is hard to earn 1 coin even in 6 months. I mined few eth and etc. And made almost 0.8 BTC. But have lost almost all of my BTC in zec and xmr trading.'
p241
aS'As you people had invested the pump of those two altcoins, zec were promising and well it were trade at 3 btc per coin if i do remember well, this is the perfect example even with the potencial of the project it has huge risks associated, thats why trading isnt for newbies, even people that are at crypto world for a long period arent able to predict the market.\xc2\xa0 There are some ways, but the free way its the harder thing, since earning from signatures arent enought, maybe 0,20 btc can be reached.'
p242
aS"That's why you just need to look for those coins that has strong development and devs have plans for it or else you'll investment will be wasted for choosing those alt coins that will soon be dumped by the devs. And hyip is not even a way to make 1-2 BTC a month or 2 instead of making you money, that will lose all your money."
p243
aS"But to get enough people as your referrals and to make any income out of it will take a lot of time, besides even if we don't invest our money we will invest our time, which is also very valuable, the truth is that without some good skills is difficult to make that kind of bitcoin in a month."
p244
aS'At this point one bitcoin is worth $800. Earning that amount of money in two months is not that difficult. If you really want to get that bitcoin you can work hard at the best activity you can do to gather that amount of money and buy your desired bitcoin.'
p245
aS'As far as I know, the higher the price of bitcoin is, the harder it is to earn more bitcoin in a month or two if your way of earning it is thru fiat and buying your own bitcoin after. Campaigns and other micro jobs also lessen their rewards since they are still fiat based. In short, as the days pass by its getting harder and harder to earn a bitcoin.'
p246
aS'Certainly, if the price of bitcoin rises from $800 to $1200 then it would probably be harder to earn 1 bitcoin than before, because the price will have a really big difference and for filling that gape someone would surely need more work and more time as well.'
p247
aS'It depends if you are working for fiat, earning that amount can be very easy if you live in the developed world but in countries where poverty is more widespread earning that amount of money is not easy at all.'
p248
aS'The current price bitcoin is around $800, in my country is certainly not easy to get it within a month, if the formal work just got a salary of around $400, if living costs $200, of course it took 4 months. The bes way is probably selling or altcoin trading.'
p249
aS'You can earn 1 bitcoin in a month if you are smart investor. Example you are a hard working member here and you earn good amount of profits from signature campaigns and you do roll overs or compounding by using your profit here to invest in altcoin trading and then the profits that you get on altcoin trading will be use as a investment on different legit sites. At the start, it sounds hard to get that strategy but if you have self discipline and you are a hard working guy then it will be possible for you . '
p250
aS"I actually im earning good amount monthly using that method, but too much safe buy if you want to earn enough profit you will take the risk, besides even you failed 1 or 2 times you learn so for me it's not lost."
p251
aS"With your rank right now you are earning .006 maximum everyday x 7 days = .042, that's a high amount, with that said, you need to consume few hours to make it each day, and you said you are using it to trade and invest in different sites, with that said, I think you are earning good enough in real life, that you don't need your earnings here to finance some of the things that you want....You are hard worker, that's for sure, I\xc2\xa0 my self, I have to admit it, I can't make it, consuming most of my time on day job and still can do more in the internet later on...All I could say is 1 bitcoin a month is not achievable by just using your earnings here even if you are using it in trading and investments...\xc2\xa0 "
p252
aS'Most of us we are dealing with that method since we are continously learning the pattern as everything about alt trading already been discuss here and the guide that we need are always been provided gor sure if we study it carefully we will be able to achieve 1btc earnings if we are in a good campaign and we invest with good alts.'
p253
aS'it is very hard to get one for free, easiest way is gambling'
p254
aS'If you are a programmer or some other guy many people need then you can try your luck on btc freelance sites. By working for a signature campaign you can earn $120. Well, you can try working for two (which is dangerous and hard, of course) and earn $240 in the best case. I think you need to come down from your dreams into reality, man. 1btc per month is huge money, you know. Especially if you plan to work 2 hours per day. '
p255
aS'Trading alts is difficult and risky since many of those coins never get any traction at all, so I would not recommend altcoin trading to anyone until they have mastered bitcoin trading and are able to bring profits every month.'
p256
aS'It is not about doing the best activity .where do they pay you for the job you do.i dont get paid in bitcoin from my employer the only thing to multiply your coins are taking some risk by gambling or trading.'
p257
aS'1 bitcoin is hard to make but I think with some trading its possible, it will not be easy but its possible if you are making the right investments.'
p258
aS"It's true, each new day becomes harder to earn 1 BTC in one month. The coin price is increasing a lot and trading with altcoins is becoming very risk, more risk than before... I think trading isn't a good suggestion to make 1-2 BTC in one month. It's not all people that can make this profit, not everybody can make a lot of money monthly. The best method is still to work, earn a salary in BTCs, to earn more, must invest on something to earn few % interest monthly."
p259
aS'Seeking online job without specific skills would really be useless because you will not be accepted easily and we all know that competition here on online world is also high the same on physical world.Having a day stable job would somehow guarantee you to make money and we should not fully rely on bitcoin itself.'
p260
aS'With bitcoin almost reaching 1000 dollars, earning 2 bitcoins by month is equivalent to 2000 by month,\xc2\xa0 and you want to dedicate only 2 hours per day? 2000 a month is good money in poor countries and by the amount of time you are willing to dedicate to earn that amount those 2000 will be very good even on developed countries.'
p261
aS"yes that's true and especially OP has ask this without invest or without capital of money i think it is very hard to do so even for some people has dedicate more work hours not necessarily to get over than 1 bitcoin per month and i think OP must be realistic that there is no huge income starting with free money and it's impossible to do so"
p262
aS"Yeah, you know what they say you need money to make money, and to make that amount of money an important investment capital is needed or if you don't have any money you need great skills to pull of that amount of money in such a short time frame."
p263
aS"If you don't want to rely on luck, investment is the best. But still 1-2 months it's a quite short time. "

p265
aS"it is hard to get 1 bitcoin if you don't have any money ready for that"
p266
aS"by having a different jobs online maybe you could possibly make 1 bitcoin in 1 or 2 months if you'll be working hard straight, I don't know what job I can suggest you in order to make it but maybe you should check on services section there are many thread that are looking for some people who has a necessary skills for the job that they are offering but I don't think that 2 hours a day could be enough as you need to work for a different online jobs ."
p267
aS'Totally no! 2 hours of online works is not enough for us to earn 1 to 2 btc amount since no clients will surely give that huge amount of money for just short period of time on working on them, it surely need a full time service not unless people will scam another people to gain big money easily. But one thing i am sure great efforts and lots of online clients will surely generate us such huge monthly income.'
p268
aS'If you are really want\xc2\xa0 make 1 BTC per month or in two month then you need three things .1) Better knowledge for trading wisely & knowledge\xc2\xa0 almost about all the altcoins ( this will make you realised that the price of particular coin how much may go down )2) Initial investment of atleast 10 BTC .3) you need time for trading almost 24 hours to make eye contact at exchange site for price fall or down .Follow my all rules you will make much amount of profit .'
p269
aS"You don't even have to invest just in able to make 1-2 bitcoins monthly. But what you need to do is to apply your skills and offer it to the people.There are good programmers who are nearly earning this amount and also graphic designers are good in this amount for their skills.Many freelancers that are employed from their boss offshore are hitting this amount. But if you don't have skill to offer, better to start with some easy task."
p270
aS'\xc2\xa0 Earnings 1 BTC when the BTC price is just $450 is easy in just 2-3 weeks. now getting 1 BTC will take me 4-5 weeks to complete the whole coin. freelancing is the best and sure way to earn BTC'
p271
aS'Last year at signatures campaign were paying 0,10btc weekly with that were possible to achieve 0,40 btc monthly, and some task were paying well like the twiter signatures, nowadays for you to earn such ammount without skill you have to risk your bitcoin into trading, gambling forex and even those way there is no way to say you will achieve 1 btc.'
p272
aS'Can you tell me some ways of earning BTC from freelancing? I have tiny knowledge on CPA marketing. Can I utilize my skill to earn BTC ?\xc2\xa0 I am a very bad trader and have lost almost 90% of my btc in trading. So no more risk . Actually I have no coin left to take a risk, even. Will you mind If I send you a friendly request to initiate a chat ? please '
p273
aS'When we say freelancing you are offering your own service and skills, just like look at the services section : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0There are a lot of services that has been offering by an individual, programmer, manager, designer and other skills that can good for freelancing. And if you have already a knowledge with CPA marketing you just need to furnish it and study more. Also remember, just offer something regarding your skills where you think you are really good at.'
p274
aS'For freelance workers it would probably take more time to complete one coin if the price goes higher because they get paid according to its dollar value, but for someone in trading they can still earn it in the same period of time as they earn profits in bitcoins which does not depend on its dollar value.'
p275
aS"sell stuff, i was able to get 1 btc in 2 months or less by selling open frme rig, at 0.12 each when bitcoin was around $600i only got half from that because you need to pay for the materials, but in the end i've sold 20+ of them and i reached more than 1 btc"
p276
aS'With the bitcoin price trading for $1000 + getting to earn 1 Btc will require more time doing freelance jobs as payment rates likely to decrease'
p277
aS'Yeah with the price of bitcoin over 1000 dollars it is very likely that we will need a lot more time in order to earn a full bitcoin due to the decrease in rates in bitcoin for your services.'
p278
aS'there is one way but a very small investment needed.just put up 0.15btc and buy the sports betting software then you can easily make 1btc a week that is 4+btc a month'
p279
aS'Nope. You can earn 1 bitcoin in a month even if you dont have money try to join signature campaign here in the forum and earn some bitcoins and use it as a capital for trading altcoins. You can offer also your skills here in marketplace 1 bitcoin is possible.'
p280
aS'Its very hard to do this but with trading and gambling it can be done but you need luck and invest smart to accomplish something like this.'
p281
aS'Working out with gambling is not that going to be an easy thing to reach this aim to have 1-2 bitcoins monthly. I would prefer to say that just work out for it in real life, get employed and that can be possibly earn and offered to you if you are going to be employed in a big company and while employed, you can work some freelancer jobs.'
p282
aS"Yeah that is one way to get 1-2 BTC monthly, I just don't know on how much he really is earning monthly but I guess he is hardly hitting the goal.Because there are a lot of people who are using his service, I even wanted to use his service but it seems that availing his service is still what is on my mind to review."
p283
aS"It's pretty pathetic that people just think of trading and gambling as a way to make one bitcoin in a month and then that's it. In gambling, only the house wins. I used to gamble but today, I look at it as waste of time and money, and nothing else. It's not that hard to learn a skill that's appropriate to you and then get hired to do that. I have a friend that studied for 2 months to do welding and now he has a job. Even simple skills like entry-level programming can give you a job."
p284
aS'If you will invest some money for earning a bitcoin is shorter time then yes it is possible and you will not need to give a longer time or you will not need to do hard work all the day for that earnings. Invest cleverly so that you are not scammed by any person.'
p285
aS'Both of these methods are still very suitable for the current situation. However, if you want a long term job which can give you 1 bitcoin monthly, you need to learn some skill or have some college degrees in order to apply for a decent job. Job is the easiest way which can help you to earn money. Better to find a job, trading and gambling will soon destroy your life '
p286
aS'much better, since we would not now if bitcoin will last forever and having a good education will totally good to get a high paying job in the future, and focusing to earn 1btc or 2 btc a month passively is totally impossible since theirs no stable earning on this kind of industry i believe, but we can actually earn for some choices like as you said but the main thing here is we cannot rely on this one since our earning is totally not exact as our expactation in bitcoins.'
p287
aS'"Some college degree" won\'t do most especially if you work in a very competitive field. You should be well-versed, skilled, and have a college degree in order to get a decent job. There are people that have a college degree but still end up having minimum wage because they\'re not so good at their field or the course that they\'ve taken at college is pretty much a waste of time.But that\'s not where it stops. Once you acquired a skill and got a decent job, you shouldn\'t be content with that. You should continuously improve your skills. Otherwise, other people would surpass you.'
p288
aS'Do faucets.Gambling.Invest.You have 3 choices'
p289
aS"No mate, faucets aren't going to be that effective and good way of earning 1 or 2 BTC monthly, you are just going to waste your time and effort claiming with it.Even you will have a lot of referrals that are active daily still that is insufficient because profit in faucets are just cents.In gambling, I don't think if you are referring to become an investor or gambler, but if you are referring to gambler, basically you will not going to earn that much in it because most of the time gamblers just lose."
p290
aS'You can always create a digital products, such as an eBook or website template, and list it on CoinMall.io'
p291
aS'Think. How would you make a thousand dollars in a month or two? Oh, I know! Get a job. Bitcoin is just like any other currency or valued asset. You have to work, to make an amount. It is not like a magical item that you can just make out of thin air. Even computers have to work for them.'
p292
aS"I got the point of that 'some college degree' you need to be specific on the field that you are going to enter because that is real life and it is going to be your source of income until you grow old. And also having a decent job is quite good enough but don't always get contented when we talk about profit, you can also have some business whether it is a bitcoin related or not."
p293
aS"There has been some discussion in my area about removing the courses that are practically a waste of time. This includes drafting, food technology, electrical technology, courses that are about communication and english, and all the courses that is under industrial technology. All of those courses in my country requires four years. There's an alternate way to learn all these offered by the government and you'd just need 2 months or 6 months depending on which course you'd take. When you take that alternate education, there's a sure job waiting for you in the city and you'll surely be skilled after taking the course. Don't expect any above minimum wage for your starting income, though.So yeah, that's basically how you make good amount of money or 1 bitcoin in a month. Take a good course, in demand even, and actually learn the whole thing. Become skilled, and always be updated on the news about your field.. Simply graduating college and having a degree wouldn't help at most times."

aS"You make it harder to earn 2btc per month if you rely on gambling it's always a risk if you try gambling there is no assurance that you can earn 2btc unlike trading there is a possible chance if you know the strategies on how to become a good trader."
p296
aS'It is possible to get 1 bitcoin per month if you do have exceptional skills that you can offer or you can use it as your asset for applying a job. There are people that are even earning higher as 1 bitcoin per month and if they are not businessman, they have tons of investments with bitcoin and they let their profit roll all over the marketplace. You just need to know yourself, the capacities you have. There is trading where you can start it out.'
p297
aS'Gambling addiction like any addiction can in fact destroy your life, but trading is not gambling, you can earn good money with trading the problem is that is not easy but for those that have the capital and patience to learn can earn money very easily without too much effort.'

aS'Coinmall is currently a new website to provide a marketplace for digital goods so it is also not a suggestible place to earn 1 or 2 bitcoins per month.

aS'I also agree they just edited the payouts what is of course logical, I think that there is nothing wrong with that, with signature campaigns its hard but with trading you can already come closer.'
p301
aS'You cant earn 1 or 2 btc in month just by signature campaign ,faucets ,and ptc. If you want to earn big invest big amount of btc but its a risky when investing hyip. Trading is a good way to earn bitcoin without any risk\xc2\xa0 but you be active on the price of bitcoin and some altcoin you like to trade.'
p302
aS"Faucets and ptc's are almost the same and if you are just a regular claimer and user of them, don't wish that you are going to get big amount with it.And with hyip, I really don't suggest it or even cloud mining because those are very risky type of investment and they are totally a scam type.Trading is good, but don't wish that it can cover up a lot of income."
p303
aS'If a campaign wants to change the pay rate due to bitcoin price changes then they should just pay in fiat but converted to BTC. because I think the whole point for people to participate in campaigns is the hope for bitcoin price going up and they get some extra bucks.And only if you are a good poster with 4 hero accounts then you might be able to earn 1 BTC in a month, but that requires time and effort.'
p304
aS"You are right with that mate, we are just telling what will probably happen about signature campaigns. And as long as it will remain and companies are going to advertise through it then that's better. So while they are still there it's good and looking for some stable job will be the best thing to do and don't just rely with signature campaigns."

p306
aS"Trading other crypto currencies is good, but that is not that profitable, some coins don't even make its take off and it dies.... You need to be very careful in trading alt coins, though many has profit from it, it doesn't mean that it is the same for everyone... 1 bitcoin a month won't be possible if you would just squeeze it out of hard work, you need to have a capital to start with and a good knowledge... Usually a newbie won't earn much bitcoin so it's not possible to earn 1 bitcoin if you are just beginning...\xc2\xa0 "
p307
aS'It is not an easy job to make 1 bitcoin in a month or 2, with free earning it will take lot of time to make btc, even though you work for 24hrs a day it is not possible. There are many faucets, games, free earnings it will take really lot of time, there is another way with investment through trading it is possible.'
p308
aS"For a regular earner, it's not easy, it would really takes more month and if an ordinary man who has just enough salary invests in bitcoin, it would cut part of his daily living routines. Probably\xc2\xa0 half of his leisure, and earning in faucets would take forever, gambling would be a win or not situation and investment is as risky as gambling. The only thing that's left is trading and that is for those who has big capital to start with so they could earn a bitcoin or two a month."
p309
aS'I can agree with you but the person who is looking for free earning will not invest because he was afraid of all these trading, in order to overcome you need to give it a try because without trying he will not many any penny in online.'

aS"There are useful career paths, of course, but I'm talking about credentialism here, in some countries to become a secretary some companies are asking for a college degree which is ridiculous since you don't need a college degree to get the phone and take notes."
p312
aS'These three are useless replies to op because he want about 1 or 2 Bitcoin without any investment Which is not possible in faucet and in gambling he will have to invest which he do not want or cannot.'
p313
aS"The payout of faucet is very low even its free I don't recommend faucet. 10years before you make 1bitcoin but in 1-2months which is not possible to happen in faucet .in the gambling yes you can make 1btc or more in just few days only but that will have investment and gambling is very risky."
p314
aS"That is true but how about what you're going to say to the person that's talking on the phone? Without a college degree, you wouldn't understand when they started talking about business. These secretaries actually have really good skills even if you think all they do is take notes, manage schedules, and answer the phone. If it was so easy, they should be hiring an uneducated person instead since that would make them save a lot of money.That's actually possible if you're relevant on the internet or if you have a really huge audience on your bitcoin-related website for newbies looking for faucet sites. Along with ad sense, you can use your faucet referral links."
p315
aS'College degree must be a filtering criteria by assuming if you are having a degree then you will understand some fundamentals of office requirements. We are learning deferential calculus in schools but I doubt where we are using it in our real life ? Similarly a college degree just to identify the right candidate based on requirements.These type of managerial jobs are best suit for females and they will get paid only in fiats then they need to convert into bitcoins to have 1 bitcoins in one or two months.'
p316
aS'Having a degree dpes really have an edge compared to those people who dont finished education and we cant really say such thing because no matter how simple the work is it still depend on the capability of a person because if you dont have that knowledge then you will really have a hard time on doing it.'
p317
aS'"I know how to do the work and here\'s my proof." *hands out diploma*Having a degree would mean that you have the necessary knowledge to do so but sometimes it\'s not always the relevant information. Sometimes the relevant information is your experience, but having a degree is a good start.Maybe in first world countries, they can get hired easily on the jobs that they want as long as they can do it and they have experience. But in third world countries, someone who has graduated college acts and behaves much much better than those who don\'t.College might not be for everybody and graduating college doesn\'t assure you good job and all but it would really really help you throughout your career. 1BTC would be something that\'s easy to earn when you got qualified to a good job mainly because you have a degree and experience.'
p318
aS'Can be done on more methods but one of the best methods is by doing it with trading or maybe some good service that you can provide ?'

p320
aS"Your kinda right with that, but people can earn 1btc in month or two if they have skills on doing some special jobs right here like programming or maybe in designing, but.if people dont have that skill well i believe also that they need huge capital to get that so they can earn double or triple on trading/forex or any program that can generate him some profits, but in bitcoin investment and tradings theirs totally no guarantee at all since theirs no stable in the world of crypto's."
p321
aS'If you are going to trade in a market without investment you are just going to earn not that much amount and 1 bitcoin is not going to be possible at all. And if you are kind of scare investing to the sites for being fraud, you need to be a responsible trader because we can now easily determine if a site is just shady and wants to scam people.'

aS'So the only way is to trade services for bitcoins?'
p324
aS'you should mine bitcoin with 10 ASIC miner  you can make 1 BTC a month if you dont have money to buy then go to altcoin exchange and trade if you are lucky and smart enough then you can make 1 btc or more For Example : if you did bought Trump coin nearby 1st jan it was 5000 sat and now 40000 sat \xc2\xa0 So you can think about it \xc2\xa0Thanks RregardsSyed'
p325
aS'See , First of all you are a Newbie . Okay . Moreover you Need 1 fucking BTC.And on top of that you want that huge amount in 1 or 2 months !Like literally , You can get that huge amount in 1 or 2 months without investing or buying Bitcoins with USD.So work hard , become a hero or legendary member , enroll / participate in some campaign and start earning.If you have earned a bit , you can multiply your BTC , by gambling or so'
p326
aS'There are couple of things :-1) Buy some btc and expect the price to rise and keep rising2) If you want to gamble you can earn much more with higher risk3) With your skills you can ask payment in btc'
p327
aS"Everyone trust trading because trading can give you good profit in short time just you need to have knowledge about it.And trading is less riskier than gambling or mining etc.So that's why everyone prefer to do trading than gambling or other jobs.Signature campaign is also a good way for decent income."
p328
aS"First of all if you don't want or you can't invest in the bitcoin in starting then you can make 1 or\xc2\xa0 even 0.5 btc in month because earning of bitcoin is easy but not much easy\xc2\xa0 .Secondly you can give only 2 hours , it is a very less time , if you need to make a better amount of money then you need to give 4-5_ hours daily for bitcoin .I will suggest you to trade according to tour recuirments , you need to iniate 0.01 btc and then start trade , you don't need to spend much time\xc2\xa0 give advance order of buy altcoin and then sell them at next day at 3-4% more profit at exchanges\xc2\xa0 , you can try poloniex , yobit , birex , c-cex.com etc ,"
p329
aS'Like I always say there is no easy and secret to make money. People will give you money if you do something for them - work of them run a service for them or offer then some articles or skills. No one likes beggars.There are ways to earn money maybe not just 2 bitcoin but even more. The best method is by getting yourself a job or starting your own business.In this forum you can try offering your skills for getting paid in bitcoin.In real life try trading bitcoins and altcoins. Invest in gold and real-estate which are considered to be worth it.'
p330
aS'Someone asking for a way to earn 1 btc a month would probably have no such capital which can make him able to buy 10 ASIC miners which would probably cost him a great capital.Trading can really be a great thing if he can manage to do that, but before doing that he must learn some basic things about it.'
p331
aS'but I am afraid to invest in ICO , already read a lot about some of the companies that failed in ICO and disappear with the money of investorswhether it can all be resolved by the escrow service ? '
p332
aS"You just have to trust it. That's all. Not every ICO is a scam. Though most of them will be either a scam or the coin or whatever they are developing will not really come up as what they say it would be. In both cases, the price of the coin or whatever they sold in the ICO will drop like a hot potato on the first they it gets released."
p333
aS'nothing really is impossible with a focused and serious mind, a mind set to obtain a huge pay by the end of a month will be ready to work very hard, but you saying "I can dedicate 2 hours a day in that. whatcan I do to make a bitcoin per month without any investment?" that is almost like sounding impossible or not serious about what you are going for...'
p334
aS"Yup, nothing is impossible if you really want it, but with that, you need to invest time and money if you really want it. Exerting effort alone won't be enough, it needs more time, and if you want it to be quicker you need to add more money. That's true, 2 hours a day of your time won't earn you 1 bitcoin in a month by working, that means you need to invest money to meet your goal. "
p335
aS'if you want to earn 1 bitcoin in a month here, you really need to spend your time watching this forum.join signature campaign, Qtum is the highest payrate for now, you can earn 0,02 in a week (member).and keep you page at service page, some people love to pay 0.0001 just to sign in their website or comment in websiteor if you have really good skill, there are some job for people making design or website thing.the best idea how to make 1 bitcoin in a month is not here mate, go outside and get some job. '
p336
aS"You can't rely on signature campaigns all your life they come and go and is not something that should be made as a living. It's just an incentive to people who post on the forum. It's not what you want to live for and not even fulfilling to do. If you're just in it for the money, then go. I would recommend just doing great job in the forum like offer your skills."
p337
aS'Easiest way is to offer your skills and work and receive/buy Bitcoin as/from payment. Signature campaigns have very low pay rates and will be only interesting for people in countries were the average wages are low as well.I also feel that signature campaigns are encouraging spam posts. But I would not ban them, because they still contribute to Bitcoin-economic activity.'
p338
aS"Yeah, the pay is really low just because it not really a business or work people should expect to pay them a good salary. It's really an incentive for people who post good quality post and also this is really good for the forum as there is some kind of economy that happens here. Because of the advertising of these services and products."
p339
aS"You know in signature campaign, we can't earn 1 or 2 bitcoin in a month, only a few campaigns are here who are paying very high, but they are not selected everyone, you should do work hard. But instead of it, you couldn't earn 1 bitcoin in a month. I mean we can earn in signature campaign, but 1 or 2 bitcoin, it is hard to earn in a month."
p340
aS'You forgot to mention "over the internet".Yes, in order to earn 1btc a month through the internet you must have some special skills, but you can easily earn about 2.5btc a month from being a cashier a McDonalnds at most of the countries.So yeah, earning through the internet is much harder as less people are willing to pay you.'
p341
aS'yes there is something free in this world, but really in rare case.How to make 1 bitcoin in a month or 2?i think we need to start from signature campaign or find a job which suit you here.do some business and trading if only you have knowledge about item that you want to do trade or businessDont gamble, its hard to stop. You will stop gambling after you realize that you have nothing left.'
p342
aS'I get 1 bitcoin in a month of trade altcoins, also aided several ways such as signature campaigns and gambling. gambling is actually just for fun, but the result could be more quickly in a short time. This way sometimes unstable. Sometimes it can get more than 1 btc or less.'
p343
aS"Gambling can give an instant profit if you are lucky but i wont risk my btc to make it grow in gambling its like giving your money to someone without assurance they will return it. i think if you have good capital you can use it in trading, it is also risky but if you know what you're doing you can definitely earn."
p344
aS'I think it will not be easy, need hard work to get 1 bitcoin in a month. If you have high investment in altcoin trading and making the right investments it will be possible for you'

aS'sound like we need skill whether one is freelancer using bitcoin for payment?'
p346
aS"I have no idea on how to make it but if you respect my opinion I will open an advice for everyone who read this. We should have a dedication of doing more profitable ways to earn bitcoin is such ways, there's altcoin tradings, signature campaigns and getting rewards from the forum threads. Save and hold your btc if you are near with your target and trade to altcoin and be firm in decision making, collect all those btc and there you could get the 1btc in one month or two."
p347
aS'This is already possible since there are freelancers who do make their jobs or projects which are being paid for bitcoin i just forgot on what site did i saw previously regarding on this matter but im sure theres one who do pays bitcoin for your skills. 1 bitcoin in a month would be easy for you if you have extra ordinary skills on programming and development.'
p348
aS'Do you really think it would be possible to make 1 bitcoin in two months by altcoin trading, signature campaign and games and rounds kind of rewards. I do not think so that we will be able to earn big from these. We must need big capital for altcoin trading to make big profits, but it would be too risky on the other hand.'
p349
aS"It's better take a loan and start invest into bitcoin trading you will make more profit from it, but at the same time you have find different other ways where you can make money with your investment. Because there are many other farms of income generation with your investment but every where there is risk involved."
p350
aS"Loans are risky, but you have to take the risk to earn more, earning 1 bitcoin from hard work is not easy, while when you take a loan and use it as capital in a business, you will earn, but you have to consider your capacity to pay when doing so. That's a good idea if you are just starting out and have a good idea to make it prosper, but if you would just keep it and wait, nothing will happen."
p351
aS"both are equally risky and my bitcoin fully to trade because it is safer and better.gambling is usually only as entertainment and I don't really put my money on gambling, and just play when getting a free bitcoin."

aS'Earning bitcoin is very hard to make because you need spend lot of time in making on bitcoin, you have find different jobs like signature campaign, twitter campaign, freelancer job etc. But you need to allocate some time for doing all these, definitely you will find one with your dedication and hardworking.'
p353
aS"Well, good luck to you if you can find a job that could make you 1 bitcoin or two without putting in any investment... Allocating a lot of time alone won't give you that big amount in one month... You need to invest money so you could earn that big, Or if you don't have money, then you should be skillful, and that skill should be on things that the bitcoin community needs...\xc2\xa0 "
p354
aS'some freelancer using bitcoin for payment on their job, such as working on a project related to altcoin'
p355
aS"That's the same case in real life. When you want to look for a job, you would also spend a lot of time searching for open spots in a company and you're not even sure if you're qualified for the job that you're going to find. At least here, it doesn't need that much skills but the payment is quite low. You know what you should do? Have a job in real life and then have a job in bitcoins too. For sure you'll get 1BTC a month despite the fact that you're not getting much salary from what you're doing in the bitcoin world. Having multiple sources of income is the key for 1BTC a month."
p356
aS'Btc works will not provide income like 1 or more btc a month. If you able to invest on trading, btc projects, lending, mining and etc means you can able to earn more than that. If you wish to earn via signature campaign and other services means its not possible at all.'

aS'it`s allmost impossible to make that money in 1-2 months ...'
p358
aS"If you do labor work and you live in a province in a third world country, then you're right. In the city, you can earn this amount of money in 1-2 months both in a third world and a first world country. If you live in the city but you still think that it's impossible to earn that much, then you're just lazy. There are people that literally do nothing all day and complain that life is so hard while there are people that work day and night and still think that life is great. Change your mindset and be like the latter one.In a first world country, even just working in McDonald's or somewhere that doesn't require a degree can make you earn 1BTC in less than a month."
p359
aS"Yes mate its impossible if OP dont have any skills that he can offer but it he knows something like programs or blogging theres a good possibilities that he can have this amount within the time span that he mentions, but if he's skills is limited he needs a big luck\xc2\xa0 or many refs to earned 1 btc."
p360
aS"trading, gambling and signature campaign could make 1st btc in a month, but in trade and gambling it's depends on your bankroll. If you have a large capital it will easily make 1 btc in a month, even within 1 week it was very possible. "
p361
aS'I would advise you to trade if you want to make 2 BTC using only 1 BTC. You should follow the market very well. You should follow very well not only Bitcoin but altcoins.Purchase altcoin with 0.5 BTC. You can fold your money by giving appropriate buy/sell orders for the altcoins you get. You can trade with the remaining 0.5 BTC.But that is not easy. If it were easy, everyone would be rich.'
p362
aS'Yea i agree, dont jump in peak price. Dont trust everyone that saif "blablabla coin" will pump, they are bullshit and coin loser'
p363
aS'You two forgot there is a lot of job offers at the moment, and people with programming skills can earn more then 1 btc monthly. There is other good jobs, selling things for bitcoins can be profitable if you can find cheap and good stuff. Gambling and trading are good, but risk is to big, anyway I gamble a lot and I had many ups and downs, its not safe income.'
p364
aS"This method to earn via online jobs can be good, but it's not everyone who has skills to work with this. I think the best to do is to find a very good in real life, best as possible, work all month long and exchange the wage to bitcoins.Online jobs are paying too low and there are much concurrency."
p365
aS"it is indeed a very good idea. but you're right, it requires excellent skills, moreover, you might have competition from around the world. may be very much design work that will be paid using bitcoin, but you have to be really good at that."
p366
aS'Well you said it right. I was once a victim of those trollers that says that this coin will pump or buy now this it will pump later. But earning 1-2 bitcoins is really a big challenge for almost everyone of us. And if you are a small time trader you need to have a lot of times before earning this big.'
p367
aS'Thats what all wants,:) but really hard to get even pro traders sometimes got nothing,, what i can say is just read read and read and we will learn,,  '
p368
aS'well that why we need to do some self studies on what coin we are going to trade with and what is his movements on 24 hours so that we can tell that its worth to trade on and we will not easil be fooled by those people who says on troll box that the pump is coming, but actually 1 bitcoins is achievable although hard but we need many alternative works to reach that one.'
p369
aS"I think it's real if you are lucky to buy some alt before bump "
p370
aS'other like being good i think you need to be good also on advertising yoursef that you can do the job as descripted so that many clients well hired your service and possibly cameback if they are been satisfied on your works, but totally its very hard to do so since their are other people also focusing on that and we should need to be unique so that we can gather more and earn more.'
p371
aS"Yes we are already there but reading isn't going to be enough and also learning. When you already do have those things you need to apply it properly. And it is true that even how pro you are, you can still doesn't have an assurance to earn that much for a month as trading is really an unstable job where you can earn higher and sometimes lower."
p372
aS'The most bitcoiners arent skilled people, with that said, isnt an easy task to reach since some signatures are paying around 0,04bitcoins and combining captcha, faucet or any other way that can allow to earn bitcoin will become an hard way to get those income but inst impossible, is just hard work.'
p373
aS"Yeah, it is right reading and learning not matter, practically we earn money, Also about the OP, i don't agree on it, if we have small assets than how we can make 1 or 2 bitcoins in a month. And secondly, if we have no capital than definitely, we should use the different ways to earn the bitcoin, and in this way it is impossible to earn 2 bitcoin in a short period of time. "
p374
aS'I am one of that not skilled and I used to get with faucets.'
p375
aS"Stop with faucets already they are just a waste of time together with captcha's. I find it tiring when I was able to keep on making bitcoins with those ways. And if you are aiming for 1 or 2 bitcoins monthly, you are going to find it out with yourselves that most of our comments here about those ways are truly a waste of your important time."
p376
aS"Don't worry about your skills every beginner will face same problems. Firstly, you need to be familiar about bitcoin because there are many post about bitcoin in bitcointalk forum. You can search those and build your account with quality post by answering question, in this way you will learn many skills about by talking with other. After learning you can join in signature campaign."
p377
aS"Yes that's the matter that op needs to understand and also you need to have something to offer for you to be able to earn some profit and 1 up to 2 bitcoins is no joke on earning that monthly. Because most of the people here are earning that badly everyday offering their products and services as well as their profit in trading."
p378
aS'Signature campaign can not be considered as the way of earning Bitcoin because you can never earn 1 Bitcoin in a month or two month with it. Moreover, I do not think that signature campaign will last forever. This type of advertisement will soon end and you can not have any income with it anymore. therefore, if you want to earn Bitcoin in a appropriate way, you can start your mining career or learn some special skill in order to provide your service on the internet'
p379
aS'The sources which you mentioned above are not the only sources of earning bitcoin but there are a number of other sources also which can make a person able to earn about 1 bitcoin in a month or two suppose he start a blog and start to invite people to that blog then in that he will not need a special skill but only will provide some news at some interval and when the traffic is increased he will be able to earn about 1 bitcoin in a month or two.'
p380
aS"Yes it is very possible especially if you are into the higher position. Those people can just convert their salary to bitcoin easily also with what you had mentioned about the illegal activities that are happening inside the government offices, it is true that's another way of earning there but I don't intend to do that when I get employed there. There are a lot of more legal ways to work in bitcoin related jobs."
p381
aS'if you want make 1 btc in a month you can chose trade, but it need some skillif gambling legal in your country you can try itand without investment i think it very hard to get 1 btc'
p382
aS"That concludes it all. You really need to have a capital to invest to make 1 bitcoin in a month, that is very useful if you don't have skill to sell. I'd rather just trade than try gambling, that's not profitable to me and just take up much time to earn if you are lucky, and if you are not, you'll end up empty handed. 1 bitcoin as a goal is not an easy task specially if you would start from the scratch."
p383
aS"I don't see till now any that governments are paying bitcoin for the work done by their employee's. Once governments accepts than many people will start making more than 1 btc per month easily but the price of bitcoin will be vary, because according to bitcoin they will pay fixed salary to us."
p384
aS"I don't recommend to try gambling just to earn that amount monthly because you are just putting yourself into a big dig.Even you don't have investment you need to do something for it but you can earn that with your own skills.That will just depend on how you are going to apply it to yourself when it comes to earning."
p385
aS"i am sure that between trading and investment have the same risk, the more money we use in both, the more risk that we should know. and if you are playing gambling for your purpose, then i can not guarantee that you can make 1 bitcoin in a month or 2 because gambling is more risk from trading and investment especially if you don't have any of experience in gambling."
p386
aS'but some people do not want to learn about tradethey want make 1 btc without hard workand i think trade is not suitable for them '
p387
aS'if there were a simple way to earn 1bitcoin on the month(with 1-2 hour per day), I would probably do all bitcointalk members would have worked on this job. if there are ~200k members it is mean 200k bitcoin every month. woow.even if there is such a job, without any skills, without starting capital and only one or two hours per day, be sure no one will publicly conferred dream job'
p388
aS'That\'s highly unlikely... Usually if there is a job on the internet that pays good, everyone who knows almost keeps it a secret... Anyway, with 2 hours a day in this forum, or even in trading, you can\'t earn 1 bitcoin in a month without investing "big" capital to start with...2 hours is not enough and that\'s actually the minimum time those big time earners consume...\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0'
p389
aS"I don't agree with you that a trader can't make 1BTC a month. a new trader cannot make 1btc a month. but an old trader who worked in this field since a long time and have good capital then he could surely make more than 1BTC every month."
p390
aS"It's impossible for a new trader to earn 1 bitcoin monthly. The only thing that it can possibly happen is when he will be guided by an expert trader. But it looks like that he is going to trade not on his own decision but with the help of other trader as well. But the real thing there is that he can earn higher than 1 bitcoin."
p391
aS'For me, in order to earn that 1to 2 bitcoin in a month I should work hard for it and invest in altcoins trading with a large amount of bitcoin investments. Maybe I should convert my personal bank savings into bitcoin cash in and then invest it to altcoins trading, I should seek guidance from my expert friend in the decisions that I will be having because its a serious matters and really involved big amount of money, which could fear to lose profit if not managed well.'
p392
aS'If you want to earn bitcoin for a month or two, these would take effort and hardwork. Determination to reach the goal. You may invest in altcoin trading, altcoins which is good to trade with. But, if you dont have much funds to earn this such big amount it really take an effort to do so.\xc2\xa0 Signature and socail media campaign is good for anyone here to earn bitcoin.'
p393
aS"If you only rely on signature and social media campaign it's hard to get 1 btc/month. the bottom line is enough capital to achieve targets such as 1 btc/month. unless you are smart in analyzing the price movement of altcoin, I believe you can get 1btc/month with a capital that is not too large. and have the skills will make it easy for you to get 1 btc/month."
p394
aS"Bigger hopes of getting bigger income needs bigger investment. And if you want to get this amount with trading, you should really be cautious on the amount that you'll invest. And if you wanted to convert your savings on your bank account to bitcoin, it is another form of investment but that is a risky thing to do, you should think about it several times."
p395
aS'Altcoin trading is more of gambling than real "work" and "earning".Traiding Bitcoin (just like stocks) is more of a work and does require skill. '
p396
aS'Even experts arent able to make 1 bitcoin monthly, currently such income does require a big number of bitcoin to get low risk and be able to get those ammount. Crypto wolrd has whales, if you part of them you will be making even more, but as normal trader you jump in and out anytime expecting proof, but ther isnt a easy way to make such volume nowadays.'
p397
aS"Alt coin trading is harder rather than buying bitcoins at lower price and sells it when the price increases. There are people that treats trading as a real work and it makes them employed as a free trader or let's say it can be considered as a job. I known some people who manage to trade with forex and their giving them higher profits depending on their skill."
p398
aS'Indeed, Altcoin trading is a lot more complex rather than just exchanging your bitcoin into USD when its price increases and vice versa. Altcoin trading requires a lot of expertise in terms of the liquidity of a certain coin in order to select the best coin to trade with that will bring you a profit whether you are in a short trade or long trade. Also you need to master how the movement of a certain coin operates so that you can maximize the margin and make a good profit out of it.'
p399
aS'Thats why most of us here. anyways, online jobs may give u miniscule amounts, but with systematic investment planning (SIP), i think the target is achievable. Dedication and patience is the key.'
p400
aS"If I were you, I'd search for affiliate programs. Especially those that have lifetime bonuses, not one-time"
p401
aS'It depends on the followingRank - look up what ranks they are allowing mate, otherwise you cant enroll.Payment - though payment should not be the biggest issue but in general people always flock into those which have highest payrates.Manager - if its managed by some Green trusted and/or known person who has managed campaigns before, you can trust they wont turn scam (in most cases)Your free time - since the campaigns should be done as a side earning, make sure you can spread the posts over the entire week and not finish everything in 2 days or rush all the posts on the last day.You need your own website and/or platform to spread your link into public and if cant draw traffic to that link its as good as nothing. '
p402
aS'Yup, hard work is the main pillar in achieving a goal and hope that we want. 1 Bitcoin is a very large amount, but it\'s arguably "small" to those who already have the determination and already have several ways in search of bitcoin. It is indeed to be able to get 1 free with bitcoin then the way to do much higher compared with those who have the capital. Signature and social media campaign both to get the bitcoin, however it also takes a lot more. You are able to make sales with bitcoin method'
p403
aS"And that's the best thing to do combining all the source of income you know whether it is with bitcoin related task or not.Trading is going to be another good source if you are that type of trader who can earn higher than 0.1 weekly BTC"
p404
aS"What do you mean by lifetime bonus? Is it the same affiliate program that gives you small amount of bonus every single day? I really doubt that it's a lifetime thing given that websites tend to only last more than a year or so.I would prefer one time affiliate programs. For example, when someone bought an item and used your affiliate link. Youtubers do this often and they seem to make good amount of money from it because otherwise, they wouldn't make all those Youtube videos and include their affiliate code in every single item that they feature."
p405
aS"I rather meant bitcoin exchanges that offer, let's say, one-time payment of $5 for a each user. On contrary, there are other services that offer a certain percentage (20%, for example) from purchases of users brought by affiliate. In this case, you can earn rewards even half a year later after you brought this user, do you understand, what I am talking about?In any case, you can participate in many affiliate programs at one time, it's even better"
p406
aS'Yeah, indeed signatures can help us to get more bitcoin. but to reach the target that we want will be very difficult for the signature to be able to give it, because we can get maximum signature in the bitcoin 0.2 BTC in a month. so in addition to the signatures we need to be able to do the other way so that 1 the BTC we can get within 1 month or 2 months, and it all takes a tremendous hard work to make it happen we want.'
p407
aS'That is highly unlikely for a person who has a daily job or own business to look after. They would be more interested in their daily source of earnings more than other sources. Its important to consolidate that money more than other risky methods to earn like trading.Though its important to try to combine all those sources its more important to make sure that you dont waste your time doing anything that is too risky since they may not be worth it.'
p408
aS'We have many different places where we can make bitcoins easily, but every where you need to invest. In order to make 1 or 2 btc in 2 months time, really it is very hard even though you work 24 hours daily. Through free system you will make less amount of money.'
p409
aS'Try to earn some satoshis in some bitcoin sites , then when you have some enough btc or satoshis invest it in reliable site that will have an interest not so big and fast but has an opportunity that will make your investment profit a little, slowly and gently yet safe. you need perseverance to make it to the top, but the most thing you must have is patient, without it you will have nothing.'
p410
aS'Currently just having some bitcoin or altcoin business might be the only way to get such income, besides those if you skilled you can work for others, but there are a lot competition online. For the people not able to develope some projects, you can try trading, signatures but its almost impossible to make you earn those, may you able to earn 0,15-0.30 btc, because 1 btc would mean a lucky investment and this doesnt happens all day some coins pump.'
p411
aS"Working 24 hours daily? That's crazy health is wealth and you don't have to work that way just to earn 1 or 2 bitcoins monthly. But the most effective way is to invest to earn this amount, there's no way to earn big profit if you are not going to invest something. If we are not going to invest to any investment type we are not going to earn this big."
p412
aS"As OP mentioned, he/she wants to work 2 hours each day and he/she wants to earn that big. OP also said that he don't want to invest as he/she is broke. That means he has nothing to offer, and that means, he/she is like dreaming that 1 bitcoin would be sent to his/her wallet without doing anything more than 2 hours. This is not possible if he/she won't invest time, skill and of course, money.\xc2\xa0 "
p413
aS"Yes I have read that but I'm replying to his comment which is about abusing yourself for working 24 hours with 'daily' on it. And that's why I said that there is no possible way to earn for not exerting some efforts for it. It's a real money where you need to do something in return the favor for us. Yes, you are right impossible thing is something he wants."
p414
aS'Even he is also telling same thing even though he work for 24 hrs he will not make 1 or 2 btc in two month time. In order to make money we have to invest them in different sectors of income. Working for 2 hrs a day it is impossible to reach his/she goal for sure.'
p415
aS"That is certainly true, but isn't it a freelance work also requires corresponding to they want ..? . While I see that work freelance which can give them 1 the BTC was when they could make a great project. Because it would be very difficult to get freelance 1 BTC within 1-2 months, now that this price is very high and that bitcoin does require hard work. Without the hard work and smart work, everything will be realized only after you guys aware of it"
p416
aS"It is the only way but he said he don't want to invest which is very funny. A person that wants to earn big amount monthly but he is no willing to invest any amount for his big returns. We really need to sacrifice some amount in able to get some decent profit monthly, we can't get something easily if we are not going to do some efforts for it."
p417
aS'Not many different places are there. The best ones are trading and mining. Trading requires your skills and analysis of the market. Mining is good for those whose other costs are cheap and negligible.Still the best way is to get a job which pays in bitcoin as these require your skills and acumen and are worth it.Free systems like faucets are worthless considered to the time spent on them.'
p418
aS'It is not going to easy making 1 BITCOIN monthly considering the fact that there are risk factors involved if the OP want to trade and other investments.'
p419
aS"So how would you have daily source of earning if you don't have more than other sources? And besides op doesn't want to invest.In the end, he is not willing to invest and he is not literally an investor. But he should take it on his mind, that there is no gain.If there is no money that will come out to his pocket."
p420
aS"If he have multiple skills then he can earn bitcoins in a multiple ways and he can achieve that target in a month or two but if he doesn't have any skills then he can try learning trading and he can invest money in trading but to make profits of 1 or 2 btc he also needs to have higher capital to invest as you cannot expect that huge profits by investing small part of capital."
p421
aS'It is possible to make that amount through trading but the op stated very clearly that he did not want to invest any money and in order to make that amount of money you need to have a decent starting capital.'
p422
aS"If I'm right, mining nowadays isn't profitable anymore since the difficulty is getting higher and instead of buying your own hardware.It's better to consider first on where you are living, if you can't afford the price and consumption of electricity of those hardware monthly.Then better to stop making mining as a way and op isn't looking for an investment but I'm sure that there is no way to earn this amount if you won't do some investment."
p423
aS"I agree and that's an ONLY IF. It's already proven that if a person does have a lot of skills that he can offer throughout the services section and other freelancing sites I'm pretty sure that he can nail it even higher with this amount that he is asking. Another thing is that if he has a broad knowledge with alt coins then he will be hired by many aspiring alt coin devs."
p424
aS'you got the point but i think multiple skills and multi tasking can help you to make 1 btc in a month if you are the same as other manager here that can manage different signature campaign i think they can earn that amount if they handle different signature campaign. if you multi tasking you will earn multi too.. skills also can help but if you only have 1 skill i think you can not reach that amount unless if you skills is like promoting affiliate you can earn massive in the future if you promote different affiliate links plus referrals bonus..'
p425
aS'Currently the only way to get such results is by investing into trading or some personal project related to gamble, even being developer you will face competition, soo you have to combine skill with trading and possible can make those, dont trust into hyip projects, they made to steal your bitcoin not multiply them.'
p426
aS"Trading is profitable, but there are times that we fail on that. Personal projects are the best, but when it comes to that, I would prefer something useful to the community except gambling and hyips.But with OP's idea is he don't want to invest anything, and use only 2 hours a day, which is highly unlikely that he would earn anything from that. All our suggestions will be nothing."
p427
aS'By offering multiple skills you may earn some decent bitcoin. But you need to very talented in order to explore your skills like developing, web designing, PHP, etc. If you want, you can add additional skills because daily many people are looking for skilled people. For that, you need to open your own ANN with all the details you owe. Then you can easily make more than 2 BTC in a month '
p428
aS"I've posted a thread like this before and now i see why almost all get annoyed with this kind of post. but you cant still blame newbies for that we just really don't know where to start with.i suggest you sir to read more on threads that where you can excel or grow, banners, advertisement, faucets, signature campaigns etc. and make a plan on how to achieve your goals. there's really a lot of ways to earn bitcoins but the fastest one would be buying it. hope i'd help u somehow "
p429
aS"Do you mean campaign managers? Yeah they are earning higher than 1 BTC a month, the more they are managing. But that's a skill for them, it is not that an easy thing to manage a campaign especially when you've got tons of campaigns to manage and you've got a lot of participants to monitor. And promoting referral links is just an extra income where you really can't rely on."
p430
aS"Campaign managers isn't an easy job and rather than get a salary you would get blamed for not doing your job well because late payment, couldn't filter participants and etc. But if you have a potential you should try it with the small campaign like altcoin campaign."
p431
aS"Campaign managers are worth to be paid for what they are being paid. It's not a very easy thing to do but I guess if OP will be trying to make a campaign management service this will be a hard thing for him to enter the scene of this industry since there are more competitors already that has built trust throughout the forum."
p432
aS'There is no harm in trying and offering to be a manager, the most important thing is to be consistent and responsible. Management time is the most important thing, and if we have enough time, I think being a campaign manager is not difficult.'
p433
aS"Well there is no harm but of course I can picture it out for OP if he is going to try it out or someone here that is an aspiring manager. Though we are in the world of bitcoin economy where making dreams possible. And it's up to you if you are determined to make this big money monthly but I just want to say that find other ways instead of this."
p434
aS'Nothing is impossible as long you do know that you are capable on this position and you could able to do the job well but sad to accept th reality you would really have a hard time on achieving this since reputation cant be built on a short period of time and the competition among other managers is really high.'
p435
aS"I don't have against for those people that are dreaming to be a campaign manager. But when it comes to earning batang_bitcoin is right, there's a lot of ways to do it and maybe opportunity will just come out if those people and business owners want to start out their own business if they saw that you are good enough for it."
p436
aS"Yes nothing is impossible but we know that we got our very own skills and not all of us can be a good campaign manager. But being a campaign manager is not just about skills, knowledge. You must be equipped with a lot of things plus experience with your entire career on bitcoin. That's why for me, trading is more preferable."
p437
aS"That's where you're wrong, kiddo. Not just in managing campaigns, but in life in general, you can easily get trusted by people. People are, by default, going to trust you if they think you're trustworthy. That's how social engineers do their attack and all the other con-artists.In this forum, you can be online and do all sorts of good things in just a couple of days. Actually, simply helping one guy will make him trust you. Maybe not exactly write on your trust rating, but you get the gist. To become a campaign manager, you can offer free services at first just so people know that you can actually do the job. Offer a lower rate than the active managers but say that you have lower price because you're still starting out and that you don't want to devaluate their work."
p438
aS'2 hours a day will be really short for you to earn a good and decent amount for a month or week or even daily.Best thing to do in earning free is just focus on faucets or here in bitcointalk you can make decent money here'
p439
aS"Yeah that's a factor that will make him hard to earn the amount that he was asking to earn on a monthly basis.And 2 hours a day, let's say that he is dedicating 5 days a week. Only 10 hours a week or 40 hours for a month, it's not actually enough.If he wants to earn 1 BTC monthly and take note, without investment."
p440
aS'you need more than 2 hours a day to learn how to earn bitcoin and you need to read and practice about the info because the more we know and practice, in the end we can collect satoshi by satoshi and finally we can have 1 bitcoin for first time. but i think if you want to make 1 bitcoin in a month or 2, you need more than this especially you should have budget to do many ways that can help you to earn 1 bitcoin that you want.'
p441
aS'Its not enough if he is not experience before. You can earn around 1 btc per month but you need a cost around 1-2 btc too.'
p442
aS"Better get started sooner than later, it's looking like it's only going to get much more difficult. "
p443
aS'since bitcoin prices more expensive, it is very difficult to get 1 BTC within one or two months. Well, maybe if you had a great trading skill, or a big business, perhaps you could easily make it happen. that you need to do is just do not give up.'
p444
aS'Yeah You got the point and i think business or multi tasker can earn that amount.. if you are affiliate marketer you can earn that amount sale your product with bitcoin sell your skills or any other way to earn bitcoin if you do it multiple times in a day you can earn that amount only in a month or 2 months depends how you are promoting your sales.'
p445
aS"No way to earn 1 btc a month if you don't have skills and efforts in making bitcoins. Gambling is the fastest and easiest way to earn and get broke again.So if you have skills, get a job, promote your skills and surely you'd earn that 1 btc. Since bitcoin price is high it will be a lot more difficult to earn it perhaps if you put lot of efforts and skills you could make it happen."
p446
aS"That's the problem that he need to face and he needs to accept the fact that if he isn't that willing to invest on bitcoin then he can reach his goal.Also I can see that he needs two things for this, time management and money management. Investment is needed for this big amount monthly.Or else he may not get what he wanted to earn and to attain the figure he gave."
p447
aS' Hundred percent true because this is only our skill that can help us to make any amount of earning in any field , so here it is more better for you to get more knowledge about the bitcoin and get study about its every techniques to make money earning in the Bitcoin .But here is a big bitter fact in the bitcoin is also that we need a better amount of Investment in the bitcoin market , so that we can accelerate our earning speedly .So it is more better to get knowledge and also start to collect some better amount of stock , so that you can start a big earning .'
p448
aS'it is hard to get it, but you can try trading but it is risky '
p449
aS'Right, Campaign managers is not really a difficult job but getting a job here on this forum as campaign manager is tough task. There are already many good managers here who are doing a really good job and it is difficult fora newbie Manager to find a space here.'
p450
aS"I don't consider being a campaign manager is not an easy job. And yes, the difficulty of being hired as a campaign manager is not as easy as we think. It's a matter of trust and as well as the experience that you've got from it. Campaign owners prefer those people that has already experience on doing so, that's why it's hard to land a job with that position."
p451
aS"In short the competition is really high since there are lots of trusted campaign manager on this forum and definitely they would always choose the reputable ones compared to the new ones without any experience on running a campaign.trust can't be built on a short period of time you would need to work hard for it and becoming a campaign manager is not really an easy task to do but It does really give decent amounts of bitcoin."
p452
aS"The signature managers job is saturated here, don't try to earn trust by this, you will waste too much time convincing others and maybe you won't earn any trust from it. Try to start a business and show to members of this forum how good it is.Give them the chance to invest on your business and offer an interest return, if you can do it successfully, you will earn trust."
p453
aS'Yes trading is risky but\xc2\xa0 not as risky as those investment site that only 3 days of operation it will lead into scam.\xc2\xa0 I would rather enter into trading cause i know i can profit on it\xc2\xa0 not like investment site which has no guarantee that you bring your money back '
p454
aS'Fastest way is trading as other were saying but it is accompanied by a very risky consequences that might happen.Unless you deal with people who are trustworthy enough then earning bitcoins should at least be easier but still volatile so in the end you still need to learn how bitcoin moves.If it with pertains on signature campaign those who are at the higher ranks can possibly make it depending on the payout rate of the campaign.'
p455
aS'Risk factors also can avoid using best escrows in all your trade. If you are doing and physical or digital good in the forum then you can use the escrows in the forum who is reliable in the forum. If you are doing btc trading in the site like lbc, you need to not worry about because they are already using automated escrow while the trade is been opened.'
p456
aS"If you know you can profit from it, then you must be either clairvoyant or you have really good trading skills. It's basically the same thing, there's no guarantee that your money will generate profit. Even experienced gamblers lose money and they always say that you should just reduce loss rather than chase profit when you're just starting out as a trader.This amount of money can only be done from trading if you already have a decent amount of money to trade (i.e. 1BTC to get 1BTC) or a little less than your target. Anything far from your desired profit will be a little too hard to do."
p457
aS'This is right some people do really believe that doing trading and do profitable on it is just as easy as pie,it may easy to say but it really hard to do.As you said even experienced traders do really still lose money how much more on newbies or starters it would really like just pure gambling afterall.'
p458
aS'You do have a point its already quiet saturated when we are talking about signature campaign manager job on this forum since there are quiet numbers of manager here which is really reputable and been selected always by most owners. Earning trust and reputation on the community isnt really easy at all.'
p459
aS'There are many ways you can do to get a Bitcoin, ranging from small to great value.To reach the target of 1 Bitcoin within 1 to 2 months I think it can be done as long as you are serious and willing to do everything. Do anything without complaining because it would at least be time-consuming, and it applies to every job.You just stay here find any jobs that you can do to get Bitcoin and this goes back to how much and expert you can do it all.'
p460
aS'Its not at all easy for newbie to directly jump into trading without gaining any knowledge but everyone has to take a chance someday then only it will add value to his knowledge and experience and its always recommended to start trading with a small amount to avoid huge losses and increase your capital slowly and steadily as you get older on trading platform.'
p461
aS"Let's get this straight if you do not work for your money/bitcoins it won't grow from trees. There are no short cuts on how to earn that much unless you gamble or trade with the little you have!"
p462
aS"Exactly, you need to work for it and if op doesn't want to invest. Then he needs to start looking for another job and just like what you had said, there are no shortcuts but with gambling it isn't going to be a good thing if you are going to go with it because we know that instead of earning. Gambling will lead you to addiction and not profit."
p463
aS"Off course, you both are right. I saw mostly people when they know about bitcoin, than they want to earn it very fast and they search the shortcut of earn the bitcoin, and also ask just like this thread. I don't understand why people ask this typical question? Even they know we get everything but only hard work. "
p464
aS"It's normal nowadays to see people thinks that way that they can earn money on the easiest way and expecting to get high profit from doing it effortlessly. And they are asking it as if they are thinking that everything can be done easily with the help of technology but still that needs hard work and other essence of earning."
p465
aS"If you really want to earn you should take a risk because that's a huge money and it's very impossible if you don't taka the risk the only ways are gambling,investing in casinos and altcoin trading"
p466
aS"You don't have to worry about problems getting profits in trading. because trading has many places for profit. one example of the things that makes us someone who can hit a target on the ditalk thread. You have 5 trading places (eth, LTC, XMR, ETC, and dash). Everything you do really well, then there is a great possibility that you can get 1 BTC in 1-2 months. Because the 5 coin is a pretty good thing for trading\xc2\xa0"
p467
aS'Nothing is imposibble nowaday. With faucet you can find many referral to get enough of bitcoin to start invest.'
p468
aS"But faucet will never give you any amount that is near 1 BTC even in a month or 2 or maybe even in a year. People aren't using faucets anymore so even if you have a popular channel on Youtube or if you have famous site, the amount of bitcoins that you'll get from referrals will never reach that much. Even if some newbies come across your website and use your referral links, they are not going to stick with faucets until the end.Some even stop using faucets right when they realized that the payrate is not that much and they've read online or they've introduced by a friend saying that you can earn a good amount of money in bitcoins. They will realize that faucet is definitely not the best way or even good way to earn bitcoins."
p469
aS'Really? How many faucet referral did you use to get 1 btc? Even in 1 year you consume on clicking those faucet it will be hard to get it.'
p470
aS'Lets say average faucet payout is 50 satoshi and you will earn 5-10 satoshi from referrals. So, you need 10000000 - 20000000 clicks from your referrals to earn 1BTC. Not to mention it is very hard to find referrals(lots of rotators, lists, forums, almost every faucet user is self-referral etc). '
p471
aS'He said he can be lucky to get a lot referals and with the earnings from the faucet invest, he isnt saying he will be able to make those from the faucet, anyway. Some people are able to get 0,10-0,24 btc just because they refered a lot people to more then one faucet, soo its possible for a few to get a good income doing nothing nowadays. Sure nowadays get huge number of referals and a new faucet that will pay for long or keep alive is hard, but 10 milion referals clicks still being possible.'
p472
aS"Refer people to use faucets is a good passive income, but the problem is that it's very hard to do. When you post you referral link many people remove your referral code and sign up in site, or use the site without give you comission.Another problem is that faucets die everytime and you lose all your referrals when this happen. One of the most stable faucets and I believe the faucet people make more profit from referrals is Freebitco.in, as the site is alive since years ago, paying well and always bringing many new features to its users. There are some users there with lots of refferrals, generating a very nice passive income."
p473
aS'Makes me laugh mate, faucet cannot make 1 btc in a month like what is OP asking,Anyway, did you try to collect it thru faucet? How long did you take to collect them all, and how many faucet referral did you use?'
p474
aS'Best way is working for btc. If u have skill u can earn in 1 or 2 month. Mean time u can earn with signature campaign, altcoin trading, bounties and gambling. For me easy and best way is gambling. For example earn 0.4 with ur skill in a month. 0.08 signature campaign 0.02 bounties. 0.05 altcoin trading. 0.55 total. Find a match with 2.00 odds. Bet it all 0.55x2 1.10. It has risk but if u want it so risk it Win or lose. If lose try again until win. '
p475
aS'You can easily make 1 btc with trading altcoins but for that you also should be ready with descent capital to invest as higher capital can only give you higher profits but do remember risk factor will always follow you either you are putting money in trading or somewhere else.'
p476
aS'Agree , every investment have a risk your money or your Bitcoin have possible to loss . In trading you can earn 1bitcoin in 1to2 months only but trading its not easy you need to learn and you make research, follow the updates of Ann thread of altcoin you want to buy , strategies ,and patience for sure you will earn if you have that. Yes if you have big capital you profit is also high but if you have only small capital the profit is small also. Sometimes your income is in your capital.'
p477
aS"It's impossible for op as he said he want to do it without investment or capital to use on it. The most possible way of doing this on op's situation is making his resume and look for the right job that he can land on.Because there's no thing as such you will earn without even investing."
p478
aS"Depends on your skill, How good are you on that. If op doesn't have any that is worth selling then he can just learn it because today, You can learn almost anything on the internet. For me, I prefer using youtube rather than modules. If OP doesn't have a capital then work for a job in real life after that you can convert your income to bitcoins and start trading/investing. Don't even try geting your capital from siganture campaigns because it is not enough."
p479
aS'I think it was hard and it took patience, faucet sites could not survive for a long time, and the biggest faucet site "faucetbox.com" was closed. I think the best way is by trading and gambling, in 1 month is not difficult to make 2 btc, and there have been many people that prove.'
p480
aS'But I think OP is interested in knowing how he can earn 1 btc in a month or two so putting fiat money in buying it is not applicable here as if you have money then you can even buy more then 1 btc in a month and that is not a big deal and when we talk only about earning 1 btc in a month then its not at all easy as you need to have multiple skills and not only skills will help you but you should also have good multiple projects in your hands from where you can expect some income in bitcoins.'
p481
aS'When I said a newbie I was not necessarily thinking about the ranks on the forum someone in the forum may have a high rank but has never earned a dollar in the internet, so that will make him newbie in the world of making money even if in this forum that person has a high rank.'
p482
aS'The thing is just working here you wont be able to earn 0,10btc monthly in the general, signatures are paying around those, and there are limited spots and a lot accounts, users trying to join them. If you trade with those btc you get from the signatures, you might have some lucky and your coin be pumped, even with those the odds are against you if you have a tiny ammount to invest into trading.'
p483
aS"Well there seems to be no choice for those people that are hoping to earn big amount without doing some effort of investing. Though the price may seemed to be low now but it doesn't matter because it will pump again and I'm pretty sure about that. If he manage to do trading or joining some campaigns he can start his trading career already."
p484
aS"It is true, there are several freelance who have high salaries. But it is not a task we will get automatically (or constant), for frelance will only work if needed, if not then they just quietly at home and do something that may not be useful (it's not all people). Trading is much better to do, because it gives a pretty good effects in the brain think the turnaround (the brain is always working). But we have to do things that are reasonable, because each thing has its advantages and disadvantages\xc2\xa0"
p485
aS'We cannot expect very high incentives from signature campaign as the income from it is very limited and low too but if he can save that income regularly then it can help him in reaching to a descent capital in future which he can utilize in trading and can become a full time trader and start making money out of it.'
p486
aS"Freelancing and trading are both non-stable jobs although trading is much easier to get into than freenlancing for bitcoin because we all know that the job positions are very limited and the skills they're searching are pretty much the same so if you don't have it then better do some altcoin trading. At the end of the day it depends per person. On his skills, interests and the amount of money that he is willing to risk."
p487
aS"Yes we know that and even you are going to add some other giveaways and social media campaigns it is not really going to be enough. But it is better to had than nothing. That's why I'm trying to point out that he can use those profit for starting to trade with alt coins."
p488
aS'Yes earning from signature campaign can help him in building up his capital if he manages to save those earnings without spending them and once he reaches to a good amount he can use it in trading altcoins from where he can make good profits and will also help him in multiplying his bitcoins over a period of time.'
p489
aS"You can't make decent money with out skills or capital "
p490
aS"It will take lot of hard work and efforts to earn 1 btc in that short period and it will also depend on what skills you hold and how dedicated you are at your work and even trading cannot give you that amount if you don't have good knowledge of it and if you invest there without any knowledge then you will surely loose your money."
p491
aS"I can't make at least one bitcoin yet hopefully someday. Is anyone here or person you know had already achieved it? Being a freelancer can really make that amount or higher, there are available jobs online that you will be paid for as low as half a million per project. And the experience you will gain is very much important and can help you in the future. "
p492
aS'Well, we will need those two not just one of it to earn better.With OPs plan to just dedicate two hours a day, it is highly unlikely that he will achieve his goal to earn even one bitcoin in one month. That is laziness IMO, or if not, he has no time to work on it and his goal is not achievable because of that.'
p493
aS'May be he is looking for quick money by doing nothing and if that is the mentality then the only way is to go for gambling where either he will make it big or loose everything in a single day and if he is willing to work and learn then trading is a solution to his query.'
p494
aS"But as of now he isn't able to join some of it as you can check he's been inactive and still on a newbie rank I guess it isn't going to be enough. Well being ambitious is going to make you dream a lot of it. But without proper requirements and source of income it isn't going to be enough to earn that amount. Just land a job already."
p495
aS'He is a newbie and to build up his member level he need to work on daily basis then only after certain time his rank will get higher and after reaching to member level he can start participating in signature campaign but he cannot expect a huge income out of it as the payouts are really low at a moment.'
p496
aS"I don't think so he is going to do that probably he already forget about his aim. But for those people like us who are still able to do so we just need to make a lot of effort and we don't have to just depend with signature campaigns as we know there are a lot of things to be considered by the company to make their campaign go on and it is not enough to earn that amount on it."
p497
aS"Don't restrict yourself only to Signature Campaigns, the services section sometimes has good offers. I like when there are new social media campaigns being started, these days it's hard to find it, but when it starts appearing usually appears more than one. So, be ready with your social media accounts when this happen, otherwise you can lose the opportunity of extra profit."
p498
aS'Signature campaigns earning are safe but they will not give you 1 or 2 bitcoins per month and not even in six months. . I think you should have good skills and you can get your services redeem in bitcoins, that way you can earn more bitcoins.'
p499
aS'Maybe we just got 0,1 BTC - 0,2 BTC\xc2\xa0 in a month with joined signature campaign and any bounties in this forum.If we just solely on a Signature campaign to make the bitcoin, maybe to reach 1 BTC we must wait for a year.'
p500
aS"Even with investment on website such trading you wouldn't easily earn 1 BTC/month (yeah it depends on how much you invest on it but who would risk big amount of money), gambling site with low-mid risk just give you a year interest which means it would a long time return, how much it needed in order to get 1BTC/month ? ofc it wasn't small amount of money.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 "
p501
aS'I agree. Signature Campaign is not enough to have a full btc in a month or two. Trading is the only way I see that it can be done. But you need to have the experience to see what coin is being pump or dump to really profit at least 1 btc a month. Gambling is possible but it is too risky. You might end up loosing your btc. So only trading is the most viable options to get 1 btc in a month or 2.'
p502
aS"Back when the price of bitcoin is playing at below $300, there are some signature campaigns here that can give a person BTC1 a month. But that is back then and if applied today, it's not possible anymore with the current bitcoin price and availability of open campaigns.Agree that we can earned BTC1 within a month thru gambling and trading but remember that is not a fixed income and if unlucky, never will happened again after you experienced a single time."
p503
aS"What trading do you mean, Bitcoin or altcoin? I agree we can get 1 or 2 BTC in a month but it's just by doing altcoin trade. Because I think the movement of altcoin in the market is very faster than Bitcoin. There have a pump or dump price and it's will be fun to us for more profits. "
p504
aS'I agree to some extent.\xc2\xa0 Well definitely if we lack the knowledge and skills, we will be having a hard time getting a whole of BTC in our wallet.\xc2\xa0 But if we are good in coding, advertisement and skilled needed by other high paying job.\xc2\xa0 1 BTC is just peanut.\xc2\xa0 Trading is a good way to go also but we need to\xc2\xa0 have a decent amount and knowledge on trading.'
p505
aS"This is what he needs to do, just make some effort and he can earn. It may not be 1-2 BTC which he is aiming but as long as he got something to earn that can be better than nothing. Also if he earn already that's the right time to make his goal fulfill by having a lot of investments and by doing some alt coin trading which is very helpful."
p506
aS"Yes, it's good to start with a job even earning low money, after some time you can save it and start something parallel, like an investment, maximizing your earnings. If you think it's better, you can convert the BTCs to fiat and start something in real life, so you make some profit and buy BTCs with your profit, next you can invest here on the internet, earning money by many different ways."
p507
aS"I wasn't able to reach bitcoin way back that year and even here on forum but the price of bitcoin by that time is still not that high as it is now.Signature campaign is not really enough if you want to earn 1-2 bitcoin's monthly, it's better to work with your own strength.Love your job and do some other part time jobs."
p508
aS'While you could grow your capital to the point where you are able to earn the quantity stated in the OP the truth is that will take a very long time or you will need to take great risks to do it, so it is better to grow your capital first and then invest or trade.'
p509
aS'Growing your capital isnt an easy thing on which you will really need to find ways on how you grow it with lesser risk it does depend on a person on how he will make efforts to achieve such target.Making 1 bitcoin a month is possible but a hard thing to achieve if you are lacking with knowledge specially on the ways on how to earn bitcoin.'
p510
aS"And most of the people that wants to earn big are having problem because they don't have enough knowledge and skills despite of it, they are still hoping to earn big. There's no way to earn big amount if they aren't willing to invest bigger amount into a legit investment like in trading of altcoins and buying and selling of goods."
p511
aS"Yeah the freelancing market is quite crowded. You have to have a convincing portfolio to showcase your skills and attract clients . I'd go with trading and lending bitcoins for interests "
p512
aS'Currently price of bitcoin hit $1050, in my country, to get 1 btc with priced at $1050 surely need a 1 month of work, if we are looking for a free way, surely difficult.'
p513
aS"It's better to have low earning rather than to have nothing. Most of the newbies are wanting to earn big amount but there are conditions that they are setting, like they don't have enough money to invest, they don't have skills and a lot of reasons they are making. Maximizing his time will be the best there are a lot of ways if he will just try it harder."
p514
aS"big wins require big risks ... you can do margin trading on poloniex and get 2.5 of your investment .. or loss it all ...over&out. c'hhhh."
p515
aS'I am new to this bitcoin business. I am still exploring and jobless at the moment. Can anyone of you give me some advices on what should I need to do to earn atleast .5 btc monthly? I am an Engineering graduate with a little background in programming. I have worked a few in some freelancing sites but now it is really hard to find a job. Thanks'
p516
aS'80% of that are on lose, 20% is your luck. 1bitcoin in 2months it can get on combination of many earning method of bitcoin you should need to work double every day, i give my best earning method, raiblocks community solving captcha to get mrai and sold it into bitcoin you do that while participating in signature campaign.'
p517
aS"If you are an engineering graduate and with a little background in programming. You may try to offer your service, since you are still newbie rank in forum, you will not be able to join some campaigns that can add up some amount with your aim monthly. Since you've got experience as a freelance already, you can still do the same and get paid with bitcoin."
p518
aS'Yes, when you are having multiple income stream certainly could make one full bitcoins in a month. I guess freelancing of programming or graphics designing are getting high payments than other works.Raiblocks is somewhat paying better rates than faucets still I do not find its worthy for the time we do spend with them also there are events where raiblock providers were not paying as they promised. Hence choosing time worth and reliable method is more important than our hard work toward making 1 bitcoins in 1 or 2 months.'
p519
aS"Here you need for this big investment .Since you are already saying that you don't want invest any money amount .So here I will suggest you for the advertisement , make a hardwork in the advertisement and get the advertiser and publisher ( you can use this method in any field online as well as Offline ) .Now increase your network with the commission .If you will move your eye then you will find that many of the sites needed a numbers of the advertisement site at cheap price , so you can make some better earning if you can start and make Hardwork in the beginning ."
p520
aS"Freelancing jobs will not give you permanent income I guess as you will have to complete the task in certain time frame and may be after that you don't find any job related to your skills so and to find any other project it may take time but trading is a good way to have constant income."
p521
aS'And also, I think not only the developers can get the bitcoin 1 or 2 in a month, the managers of the Signature campaign in this forum I think also can getting 1-2 Bitcoin/month. For manage a Signature campaign, maybe they can get 0.1 BTC. Certainly, plus the results of the Signature campaigns which they are joined.'
p522
aS'If they can manage multiple signature campaign they can earn more than 1 btc monthly.. but it is not easy to become manager only selected people can manage signature campaign those who also knows about the\xc2\xa0 rules of this forum. And you need to become trusted first.. because you will handle the funds for signature campaign..'
p523
aS'Without invesment? Ok You can sell stuffs in bitcoin or you become cryptocurrency developer paid in bitcoin'
p524
aS'These are the only ways to earn this amount and with 2 hours a day for a month. But I guess he needs to dedicate more time in able to earn this expected profit. And he should sell stuffs that will be in demand so that he will be able to earn some good amount or else he needs to be hired and get a good paying employer.'
p525
aS"It's just a messed up country that applicants who know people inside the company get the job than those who are actually qualified. Sad thing also is I took eight years to complete the degree because my parents cannot afford to send me to school, therefore companies often pick up those freshies who are younger than me. And I am stupid enough that after I passed the Licensure examinations, while waiting for calls I went back to school to study another engineering major thinking it will pay off in the future, now ending me up broke. I just got hired but I am still waiting for the call if when will I start. The base salary here for engineers range from $300-350 monthly, WITH overtime considered. I can work 18-20 hours daily so I am looking for a good opportunity to earn coins or dollars online within that 6-8 hours. Its a shame that a guy like me who graduated with honors in high school and 2 points short for top 10 in the national exams ended up like this. Thanks for the advice though, I have been considering that for a while."
p526
aS'Thank you. Are there any good sites that you can advice that would really pay?'
p527
aS'totaly agree, alot of cheap developer , i think if he speaks 3 or 4 languages you can\xc2\xa0 earn of cash'
p528
aS"It may give you permanent income but as long as you find a good contract which is long term then that will be fine.And it's up to the cost of your living, if you are a family man, you need to find for some other ways of earning while being employed as freelancer.Since we are in bitcoin industry, you can consider to trade alt coins while working which will be beneficial to you.It's about survival and once you had enough for investing to another one, go for it."
p529
aS"Yeah to become a manager signature campaign in this forum is not easy, it's very difficult if we are haven't a good trusted in this forum. Of course if they can manage multiple signature campaign surely they can earn 1 btc /month. "
p530
aS'If you are skillful in coin designing, signature designing or trading means you can be able to earn decent amount when you are in low ranks. If you proof to show your projects. Please create the thread in the services with your skills. If you are helpful for their project. Definitely they will take you.'
p531
aS'Here in the forum there are a lot of opportunities where you can try and will pay you for real. You just need to surf around and be hardworking, there are people that are working hard with alt coins. You can work as a translator and you can even be hired for manager of their bounty distribution and became directly hired from them.'
p532
aS'Yes, even some people are not showing any interest in finding the suitable job for them but they need money. There are plenty of opportunities where you can make some decent with the knowledge you have, Translation job is one of the best options where you can make some decent money with altcoin but it is not possible to make 1 or 2 BTC in a month.'
p533
aS"Depends. There are times when ICOs don't reach the amount of money they are aiming for so they just burn all of their coins and all of the Bitcoins/Ether are sent back to the sender. Also, there's only one translation per language so you have to be the first one to say you're going to translate it. Sometimes you'd be lucky that the guy that translated the thread used a simple Google translate. You can report it and do the translation yourself.There are also times when even before you get the bounty, the coin is already dumped and/or the dev has already ran away. A lot of things can happen so don't always just translate whatever coin. Some ICOs are obviously low-budget. Avoid those type of ICOs."
p534
aS"That is very hard to get translation jobs. There are many people trying to get the same job and as you said, you need to be very lucky to get a job like this with so many people looking for the same thing.And receive payment in bounties is terrible, you will probably receive some coins that doesn't value anything, so total waste of time... I prefer to receive payment in Bitcoins only."
p535
aS"Competition is there everywhere, if you aren't going to work hard for the industry you'd entered and you want to earn bigger amount, in the end you will give up. But if you are inspired with those people and you try to go with the competition and once you built out reputation with your service customers will eventually come to you."
p536
aS'The easiest way is known to anyone get a job and save every single dollar that you can and then use that money to invest or to trade, it is hard but if we aim to get a better future for ourselves and our loved ones then we need to start now and not later.'
p537
aS"Yes, I have been exploring this forum and so far, it is the most helpful forums than all of the others that I have logged on. It's been 5 days since I think since I started exploring cryptocurrency and all the opportunities are mostly listed here, and what's best, the most good-paying are in this forum. I have kept my faucets to a minimum of 4 tabs, I stopped ptc's because they won't pay much if you have no referrals. I remembered that I have an old account in a site which audits calls and I earn about $6-8 a day and I will get my first payout tomorrow, It's about $12. I plan on dumping the rest of it, less projected expenses, in my wallet and start holding a few stable altcoins. And as I read here I found which alts are stable enough. For now, here's my gameplan:Since I am still broke and if I dump all the $12 in my wallet, I'd starve next week. So I'll keep the $4 in my wallet and trade it in altcoins and dump after it gets a little high value. I will work 8 hours daily on my audio transcriptioning site until my work calls, probably I'd reach $30+ on my next payout and keep the $8, dump the rest in coins. While working, I'll collect on a few faucets. I'll spend 4 hours here in this forum, getting good opportunities which will pay better than what I get right now, or atleast add on my daily income. I'll spend the 4-6 hours improving my skills, landing a job that would reach my target monthly income.And after I get out of being broke, keep investing until I can dump all my coins, go to Spain and enjoy retirement. If any of you guys can give me a better idea, I would love to hear it. This is the best community I have ever been into so far. "
p538
aS'Precisely, most business people will be more concerned with skill than the words coming out of our mouths. Because the only skill that can give your company the advantage and can make money, while the Word will only produce something sometimes gibberish or not bound to happen. So better indeed focus on skills we have and continue to practice so that the skill can provide it owned the best for our lives and never forget our origin against in success\xc2\xa0'
p539
aS'Correct, that is why I am still hesitant to take my first service here without improving myself. I do not want to have bad first impression, let future clients hesitate on getting my services. '
p540
aS'Exactly, your suggestion is right, if we are good in trading and have a skills to do trading, than we would earn with 2 months 1 bitcoin. But as you said about gambling sites, if it is trust-able than should try it who want to earn hurry. '
p541
aS"I prefer trading than gambling, because by trading we can get gains 30-50%/month. It's because the price movement in the Market very quickly, so the rotation of funds we will be fast too. Sometimes the people chose the wrong way to get 1-2 Bitcoin/month, i.e. they choose invest at HYIP or Ponzi scheme site."
p542
aS'Right on point. Gambling is only for the rich people and for the well disciplined people who knows how to control themselves. But for people who lack patience and do not want to lose all their hard-earned money, trading is the best suggestion. On my opinion Ponzi and HYIP schemes are good for short-term, low value investment. They work on the first month or two but if people are planning on long term goals then trading and services are the best options. '
p543
aS"But what if the time required for ROI is longer than one month or two? I wouldn't really recommend ponzi scams since it's a scam. Even if you're able to ROI in less than a month with the help of the referral bonus, you should be ashamed of yourself because you're basically scamming people. You know that it is a scam but you still lead other people.I even doubt that you'll ever get referrals nowadays as almost everyone already knows about that gimmick. Just like MLM which used to be very popular back in the day. There's not much MLM users around as they get bashed so much so it's much harder to make money from MLM and ponzi since you can't get referrals and referrals are the only way that you'll make money from both method."
p544
aS"Yes, maybe you're right. I will really look into that as I have not much knowledge in these schemes. Thank you for the advice."
p545
aS'That is why it is better to take our time, no one begins knowing everything about anything that I why we need to read a lot and inform ourselves, being in this forum is already a step in the right direction and if you add another sources and some book then you can learn very rapidly the basics of trading.'
p546
aS'Agree with you, that this forum is steping stone to be a good trader and we have choice to explore other forum, site and other related topics on trading method to become a good trader because more knowledge on trading is the advantage to get more profit every time you do trading and it would helps to lessen the risk of you money.'
p547
aS'is not easy to earn 1 btc in a month.go to invest sites and deposit your money.or try advertise on google adsense,facebook,twitter, etc.'
p548
aS'I also want to know how it because I have not been able to get it, there may be input or guidance to get it from friends in this forum I will follow the recommendation, but the core of all that we have spirit and work hard to get it and the most important beliefs.'
p549
aS'Theirs a lot of critical info that we can get here and that is the most important of all to became a traders since all fuds came and posted here first before its spreads out on some certain trollbox. And also we can seek some info if devs are active enough and had better plans for his coin so we may knew that we can get some profits by staking at those coins he handles. And lets explore more onhere so that we can see how better the altcoin tradings interms of profit generating.'
p550
aS'it will not an easy to collect 1btc in 1 month if you earn bitcoin just for free'
p551
aS"Just keep us updated here on what happened to your investment with betting on how is it going. Have you managed to grow that $20 you've got and are you near on claiming the bonus? I suggest when you are already done with it, stop doing the martingale system. It may be effective at the beginning but in the end it will give you lose. But still if you are lucky with it, take the risk if you can."
p552
aS"you can't collect bitcoin for free, or you are a scammers, but you can make 1 btc in a month, it's not that hard if you know what to do, like trading or mining, if you choose the correct altcoin to buy or to mine, you can go up to 1 btc per month, but you need to invest to have your 1 btc per month, if you can't invest the only way is signature campaign, but it won't make you 1 btc per month"
p553
aS"That's right if you want to earn 1 btc then you also should be ready with a higher capital to invest as money attracts money so if you have invested higher capital then you will also earn higher profits from each and every single fluctuation."
p554
aS"There is not a thing that can give you an advantage to us if we do not have the hard work and commitment. Trading has a high level of risk, but if we can follow or figure out the flow of trading with capital funds or good then that we have now is not a hindrance. Because capital is not the main thing in the world of trading, skill and hard work that will also give you an advantage. So, for those of you who still think that trading requires large capital then it's something misguided and wrong. Skill is the main thing in profit and capital only as a complement\xc2\xa0"

aS"Hello. I've been busy for a while. I have been studying trading and how it works, and I have been reading sites and any online opportunities to earn (e.g Adsense, blogging, etc.) that would be lined with my field so I can put more work on earning rather than learning. And update - I lost $10 yesterday and gained back $15 today. I still can't withdraw the funds since it requires me to bet 80x the value I doubled. So I am just treating it as my time deposit(with really high risk). Now I got about $12 out of my account(from faucets and one generous wallet dev that gave me 10,000 dogecoins) and I'm ready to trade, waiting for the coin value to lower a bit. I have registered for poloniex but I am still not confident in my trading skills so I am still reading stuff. Good thing is I can start adding funds to my wallet thankfully this end of the month when my first paycheck arrives. Tabulating my finances, even how simple my table is, really helps me monitor on what is my progress and cuts off my unnecessary expenses. "

Good job and congratulations that you are hired and will earn $250 a month, that's already good enough to consider instead of having nothing.

p558
aS"I'm curious on what kind of job he applied that paying 250$ per month. But 250$ is a good amount for trading, Not that high but not that small amount too. It is a very nice idea to invest it on trading because your payment has a long time frame and it is advisable to put it on trading, You can have a chance to have a profit while waiting for your next salary. And i'm sure that you can have a good profit out of that time frame because of the volatility of the price of altcoin, Even a week can give a huge variation on the price of altcoin, Just study on when to buy/sell of alt coin because that is the most important part of trading."

Just advertise your skill here on the forum and many other places, people who need your services will pay good money for it, that may make you to earn more than one bitcoin also within a month.'
p564
aS'I have been here for quite a number of months and I havent made that much but that dosent mean anyone cant make it happen, in my own point of view it depends on the level of risk you are willing to take and since you said you dont want any investment and your current rank then signature campaigns wont do the magic even if you rank higher. So you are left with two options in my own opinion which is either gambling or sell your skills. Gambling is risky, but if youre lucky, you can make your target then the skill can actually do the magic if it is relevant to what is done here...'

aS'Hello there, if you want to purchase the Antminer S9, it is more safe to buy it in the exchanges like HitBITC or other exchanges than using the forum or telegram.

p6
aS"Depending upon where exactly you're based in the UK, I would suggest you to check around some of the tech system shops nearby your area and try visit some of the big ones out there. They've already stocking up those miners since they've been on a high demand and you can probably strike a deal if your negotiation skills are good."

S'1) Do you think about this news will happen ? 2) Do you think paypal may accept bitcoin in next years (3-7) or it is impossible ? 3) Do you think bitcoin will be better than paypal ? when will happen ?4) which better for now PP or BTC ?'
p1
aS"PayPal doesn't directly accept Bitcoin, but Braintree, a division of PayPal has partnered with Coinbase to accept Bitcoin.Currently, Bitcoin network processes around 7 transactions per second, while PayPal with an average of 200 tps. In terms of scalability and daily transactions volume, Bitcoin is much far behind PayPal. But apart from being a good store of value, Bitcoin could also be a better decentralized version of PayPal by building second layer payment systems on top of Bitcoin, Lightning Network.So in future, Bitcoin might be better than PayPal, but again it depends on how users will treat Bitcoin, as a store of value or medium of exchange and the extent of merchant adoption."
p2
aS'Undoubtedly, bitcoin is already better than paypal by its highest demand and even better than other world assets like gold.People no more like to bear feableness of paypal. Paypal either have to embrace bitcoin as one of their payment method or they must get off sooner.In just a few years, people will have an option to pay via bitcoin their local shops and the bitcoin will be fully dominating over all payment methods including paypal'
p3
aS"i can answer your no 2&3 questions.PAYPAL never accept bitcoin for sure.And I think bitcoin will be better than paypal. but need huge time and huge comunnity supports.But Don't know when it will happen"
p4
aS"Too early too assume, they won't kill their business.Possible but still they have to study that very well on how it can affect their business and service. I'm thinking about PP>bitcoin service, they might do this.Yes.I hate PayPal for now but comparing the current fees, they are the same."
p5
aS'You cannot say outrightly that bitcoin is better than PayPal without putting it into some perspectives in the sense that currently when it comes to acceptance and integration with other financial institutions, PayPal is still way ahead of bitcoin as its mostly used by all freelancing sites which you can even pay directly to your local bank account without any exchanger.But when you compare the freedom, bitcoin is better because bitcoin does not discriminate against anybody or nationality as the case of PayPal that would intentionally limit its services to citizens of a particular country.'
p6
aS'papypal finished their activity in our country \xc2\xa0'
p7
aS'Why Paypal should accept bitcoin. Bitcoin is the best money transaction medium than any international transfer options. If paypal is there are payment API in any e-store even bitcoin payment API is also can be added that. Bitcoin is the competitor for Paypal and all over money transaction medium. Since many corporates making money as a business in that way so that is the reason they allowing bitcoin to work in the many countries.'
p8
aS"To say the truth I don't think it's important. Why do we need to use Paypal if we have Bitcoins that are much better to make transactions? If Paypal is smart they will surely adopt Bitcoin in the future, depending how Bitcoin continue growing, in the next years. At some point they will need Bitcoin to survive as payment method system on the internet, even if it's worthless for many people as Bitcoin is already better than Paypal."
p9
aS"1) Yes, it may happen sooner or later.2) Yes, 3-7 years is a quite long period of time, so I'd say it's absolutely possible.3) Paypal is currently cheaper and faster than Bitcoin. The pros of Bitcoin are that it can be anonymous and you can send any amount you want to anyone. Paypal on the contrary has string limits and regulations.4) As already said, paypal is better only because it is cheaper and faster. On every other aspects Bitcoin is far better..."
p10
aS"1) Yes2) That's very likely going to happen when bitcoin has a wide range of users and the mainstream media keeps on talking about bitcoin only.3) Yes, because it is decentralized.4) For now bitcoin fee is quite high so go for PayPal."
p11
aS"PayPal doesn't need to implement Bitcoin in its main platform, and for that reason I strongly believe that it will never happen. PayPal serves a certain purpose, which attracts people to use it, and that despite all the complaints of people. I personally find that it focuses too much on the buyer and not really on the selling party, but this business model works perfectly for them, so they have no reason to change it. PayPal is seeing its user base grow continuously year after year, so it's safe to say that they market themselves very well, and that there is a decent amount of demand for their platform. It's not a shocking growth they experience, but it's at least consistent."
p12
aS'I think the future, specifically the next 3 years, Paypal will integrate bitcoin into to do intermediate transactions. This will make Paypal more and more popular. And one day BTC will replace Paypal to become the most popular form of payment in the world\xc2\xa0 '
p13
aS"Nope. It is better if paypal will stay as it is, but as far as I know we can still ise our bitcoin to paypal but will automatically converted into fiat.Nope.Nope, they are both has a potential and has their own benfits to other people. They have different capabilities. For me it's bitcoin since we all know that we can do a lot in bitcoin and we can also trade with bitcoin."
p14
aS'Paypal will remain the same and will work better that way. Bitcoin is best because it still remains underground and anonimous. Its like mixing an oil to a water. '
p15
aS"I can't see Paypal itself accepting Bitcoin tomorrow or in the near future. Why? It is because for me Paypal lives on its own and doesn't really welcome any change on its platform. Other than that, Paypal charges higher fees so I don't think it'll be good if it accepts Bitcoin on its platform. "
p16
aS"it will never happen that paypal accept bitcoin, all I know paypal is very strict I think this is bad idea if they accept bitcoin because maybe it will double the transaction fees,. I better to use bitcoin than paypal because no need to verify your account to send your money I don't know paypal if they still strict verifying account first before sending money."
p17
aS'Sooner or later paypal accept payments from bitcoin why for the good reason bitcoin is the most popular form of payments and bitcoin does not discriminate\xc2\xa0 anybody and nationality .'
p18
aS'i will answer your question with my opinion, all of my answer is full of my opinion1) no, paypal never accept other currencies into paypal balance, maybe you can exchange it in the exchanger to get USD from bitcoin2) maybe it is possible but it have a low chance3) yes bitcoin is better than paypal, in paypal you need to verify your account with Credit card and something else, i know its makes secure but its hardest method if the customer doesn;t have cedit card'
p19
aS"I don't think PayPal will directly accept bitcoin. It does them no good besides you can't ever compare bitcoin transaction with that of PayPal. So it's a no go go. "
p20
aS'Paypal is the direct competitor of Bitcoin so not a chance in hell. Bitcoin is designed to be peer-to-peer effectively making PayPal services absolutely redundant if it became mainstream. '
p21
aS'This may happen in the future maybe even bigger news will come and bigger companies will accepts bitcoins as a legal payment for their service,but looking at it right now seems impossible since bitcoins potential is not enough to work with this such big things'
p22
aS"1) Of course it will happen, in my opinion everyone will accept bitcoin once it will be popular enough.2) It might need up to 10 years for that, depends on how many people will actually want to use bitcoins as a currency.3) It will be better because of smaller fees and privacy.4. Currently paypal is better because you can't use bitcoin to pay anywhere, i hope it will change soon "
p23
aS"1- No. Because BTC and PP are 2 competitor payment processors.2- It's impossible, will never happen.3- Bitcoin is already better. However altcoins are better than BTC in lower transaction fees and faster confirmations. 4- For now BTC is better. BTC is a newer technology than PP. Altcoins are newer than BTC."
p24
aS"Altcoins have lower overall transaction fees because their network doesn't experience much usage (if any at all). It's not that long ago where people were referring to Ethereum as being the Bitcoin killer, but yet it failed miserably in that aspect. Due to an insane amount of usage, its fees have shot up significantly, and its network experienced various major difficulties. No chance.What is that for logic? It all depends on how and in what scenario you use one of these two options. PayPal functions very well as platform for people to transact with each other, buy stuff, etc. Bitcoin severely lacks in that aspect. Bitcoin is better in other aspects, but not in the aspects PayPal enjoys most of its usage."
p25
aS"Very possible to happen, not only considering PayPal but as well as facebook,youtube, google and other any popular websites and services.It's because there's still a big debate on what coin to support for miners but if everyone of us will be only supporting one coin and bitcoin only marketplace this is going to happen in no time."
p26
aS"It is impossible for paypal to accept bitcoins at the current state of crypto currencies.Currently, bitcoin and other digital assets are unregulated, as long as they remain unregulated,it will be impossible for regulated companies to keep it(there is a difference between accepting bitcoins through a 3rd company such as bitpay, which converts the bitcoins at the payment time, and between accepting bitcoins and keeping them, which shows that you believe in the currency for the long term).Paypal can't touch bitcoin as long as it remains unregulated, we need to lead a regulation if we want paypal to consider accepting bitcoins as a sort of deposit."
p27
aS"You have a point there. But if PayPal will not welcome change especially now that cryptocurrencies are starting to have their own niche in the digital world, they will be left behind. Though if you will think of it, bitcoin is one of their competitors with how transactions are made. But I think later on, they will be integrating bitcoin. But how? I don't know the answer yet... It's just like banks vs. bitcoin, now, banks are starting to accept bitcoin deposits, and starting to utilize the blockchain in their operations."
p28
aS'If you say facebook, google or even ebay accept bitcoin i will agree with you. Paypal will never accept bitcoin because paypal is forbidden exchange other virtual currency in the rule of paypal.At the moment, I see paypal is still better bitcoin because paypal is accepting anywhere but in the future bitcoin will better '
p29
aS'In the global marketplace, rivalries can be friendly for a day, there are many examples. Apple and Samsung look like competitors, they can act jointly. But I think Paypal is a finished company.'
p30
aS'would be great for paypal if receiving bitcoin. but, I think paypal will not accept bitcoin. well, basically paypal is a bitcoin rival, and is the most trusted dollar depository on the internet. I think it will happen for a very long time'
p31
aS'I think Paypal will never accept bitcoins, cause then will be so many issues with refunds. Thats my opinion. '
p32
aS'i think paypal never accept bitcoin now or in future , for me bitcoin better than paypal . fast and easy for exchange and small fee but for shopping paypal better '
p33
aS'Eventually it will but we need a push and more advertising to bitcoin for PayPal to knows the demand of its clients.That\xc2\x92s is precisely possible but a 3 years from now is too early a 5-7 years might be the date.You mean usd than bitcoin, if yes then I\xc2\x92m sure with that. Bitcoin is way more better than a fiat currency that is controlled by corrupt system.I do use both but minimally on PayPal, I\xc2\x92m more of a bitcoin user now. I\xc2\x92m more feel freedom using cryptocurrency than a much detailed transaction with PayPal that must be legally binding.'
p34
aS'When banks start to accept BTC, PayPal will follow'
p35
aS'bitcoin is the strongest today and hunted and used very much\xc2\xa0 as a means of payment online can even be received in various currency exchange in various countries. bitcoin has exceeded paypal'
p36
aS'Paypal is legalized worlwide company wich provides fiat service to exchange and pay to any product with safety to seller and buyer. Bitcoin for other side isaccepted worlwide for a few people, most merchants avoid it, and isnt legalized, only Japan has legalized it. Currently at some point bitcoin transactions are becoming more expensive then paypal, soo its possible into the future bitcoin becames legalized and accepted into paypal, but the run of low fees transactions bitcoin will loose to paypal.'
p37
aS'1) No it will not, because Paypal hates bitcoins and they do not work well together. There is no reason why paypal would accept it in the near future.2) Again, no. It is impossible. 3) It is already. Paypal is not good for the sellers since chargebacks are quite easy to do. However, bitcoins are good for sellers and bad for buyers since the transaction is irreversible. It would be hard to compel the seller to give back the money. This could be mitigated though if there would be an escrow.4) BTC of course.'
p38
aS"Bitcoin at this point has only surpassed PayPal in terms of value moved from one place to another, and that's really it. It mainly comes from the fact that Bitcoin's price has literally exploded in value this year.Aside from that one thing, PayPal is still leading over Bitcoin. PayPal stimulates people to spend money due to the convenience and usability that it offers, where we have to keep its world wide acceptance in mind as well.Being a Bitcoin enthusiast is fine and all, but there is no need to exaggerate its current reach. Bitcoin has a lot of catching up to do, and that will take some time. And even if it did, the volatility plays an important role as well."
p39
aS"They will at some point and yes they are quite dependent to the banks. It's quite early for now to assume that PayPal will accept bitcoin but there are good speculations out there that there is really a possibility.Will try them out if they are now into bitcoin but so far I think they are still studying on how they can adjust their service together with bitcoin."
p40
aS'PayPal is a technology marvel, similar to that is our bitcoin. Both differ based on the platform which makes them effective. Long back itself Peter Thiel of PayPal said, if he has known about bitcoin before PayPal he could have used it for all sort of transactions. Also said based on the necessity might incorporate the bitcoin into PayPal for usage in the future.'
p41
aS'Paypal accept btc for any transactions was good paypal makes transactions fast and better easiest way to provide your needs because of paypal they have atm now and simple to transacts btc converted your earnings it will possible. '
p42
aS'Yeah it is the currency of the year and the bitcoin is now being more and more famous to have the huge potential as the currency and the money now a lot of the malls are selling the goods just for the bitcoin and it has the source of the bitcoin buying and the bitcoin shopping so if you are having the bitcoin and you want to use the bitcoin online shopping it is not very tough and the sites will give you the best source for it.'
p43
aS"1. No, I don't see any reasons why Paypal would accept bitcoin and I would rather see that they are in competition.2. No, I would rather believe that paypal would accept any other e-currencies which is centralized or being created by government.3.No one knows since we do able to see that bitcoin isn't been known yet globally unlike on tradition paypal.4. They do have their own path way but when it comes on tradition payment system being used by people online then paypal is well known."
p44
aS'Never never never, there is no reason why a bank based service should accept the technology that will destroy banks'
p45
aS'Yes and it will happen because now a lot of the banks are even accepting the bitcoin and it is the reason why the bitcoin is helping the people to save the future and if he banks and the paypal will accept the bitcoin it will increase the bitcoin value and the price to some more extent I am use to with the bitcoin and it is just because I am having the information and the knowledge so I think it is the good news of the year now.'
p46
aS"Neteller and Skrill are both huge payment service providers incorporated in Europe and they accept it since a long time. PayPal is based in the US and I think they didn't and will not accept bitcoin because it's a high competitor for the FED and PayPal likely has deep connections to the upper class there. I think bitcoin is better than PayPal because it's not connected to the fiat system, but after the manipulation of BCH I meanwhile prefer altcoins."
p47
aS'You can expect anything to happen in the future. I am very much sure that this will happen and that too in very near future. There is nothing impossible in this world. You should always hope for the best. Bitcoin is definitely far better than that of PayPal. It will help you in living a comfortable life and you\xc2\x92ll be able to earn a very good amount of money by investing in bitcoin.'
p48
aS'I think subject of thread should be changed to "Future of Bitcoin in PayPal" as the subject "PayPal accept Bitcoin" makes one think that PayPal has started accepting Bitcoin as payment method which is not true. Clearly, because PayPal thinks Bitcoin as a rival and also commented against Bitcoin whenever they got chance to diminish its value. I think PayPal will try every method to stay away from Bitcoin but with increase in demand they may need to change their plans and integrate Bitcoin as payment method.'
p49
aS'1 until now, paypal never announcement or update news statement about bitcoin2 i think very dificult paypal accepted bitcoin, bitcoin competitor and bitcoin still not yet regulation in big country china or USA, if paypal accepted can big problem about money laundry3 this now bitcoin is above paypal, but about transaction in online store, paypal still above bitcoin, because all big market place sample ebay accepted paypal,4 point 4 is ready answer in point 3'
p50
aS"1) I don't think this will happen any time soon. If it does, I think paypal will end up fining it because it's not in their best interest to hold bitcoin.2) It's possible that if bitcoin gains some higher ground and it's a lot less volatile that Paypal would accept it, but I don't think that will happen soon. Maybe by 5 years? Not too sure right now.3) I don't think Paypal is better than bitcoin, but I do believe that paypal has a larger user base, and it will have a larger userbase as long as fiat exists.4) For now, Paypal is better if you're using fiat and it's accepted much more widely than bitcoin is. Bitcoin is better if you're looking for much more of an investment."
p51
aS'Everything can be happen depens on situation.pp and btc had different function. So we cant compare it..'
p52
aS'Yes it is also what I think since reading this thread, there is a writing error that might make some people wrong thinking. Back to the point that Bitcoin is currently developing and Paypal I think is very different from Bitcoin, it can be said that paypal is a method to send money and Bitcoin is money. This is to be understood, If paypal received Bitcoin of course this is a big improvement because Paypal has considered Bitcoin like the current currency. this can increase popularity and trust in Bitcoin. We all know that currently PayPal is one of the largest market in online financial transactions, If bitcoin can be integrated then both Can get market share that is increasingly widespread. Paypal and Bitcoin will be equally profitable. Paypal will have more users and Bitcoin will have a positive price increase. I would suspect that It will be one of the greatest momentum that occurs in the era of digital transactions. It will be history that will determine the future.'
p53
aS"I doubt it. Paypal is all about charge backs and being closed-source. They would never want the opposite. Elon Musk would have a fit if someone ever brought this up to him. Paypal is for the banks to remain in control but through a veil. It's win-win for them."
p54
aS'I think PayPal was first to be released before Bitcoin was released, though I\xc2\x92m not quite sure about that. There are lots of people who trusts PayPal, so I don\xc2\x92t see anyway for Bitcoin to really compete with it. I think we should just mind our own business here on bitcoin, while PayPal fans mind theirs. '
p55
aS'Just wanna answer some of your questions. First Bitcoin has already surpassed the paypal markup so BTC is huge and better. I dont think Paypal will accept BTC, \xc2\xa0never. Bitcoin is a direct competitor and a threat to them to them. '
p56
aS'Exactly! There is no need of doing such kind of thing. I don\xc2\x92t really think so that PayPal have started accepting bitcoin. Infact, there are less likely chances of this thing to happen. I personally think that this is not a good idea. Like you said, it is same as mixing of oil and water. There is nothing profitable you are going to get in return by doing so and I don\xc2\x92t think so that this will ever happen.'
p57
aS'Yes,No wonder if we will see many websites including paypal are accepting Bitcoins in future. Bitcoin is become more famous nowadays. Who knows Bitcoin will become better than paypal in future.\xc2\xa0 '
p58
aS'PayPal as a payment gateway might get associated with bitcoin in the future for business purpose, but already it has developed its own platform and has gained support from users worldwide through its cross border transaction service with ease. Bitcoin is beyond PayPal, but the uncertainty makes people believe PayPal though bitcoin provides with a growth that is unachievable by PayPal.'
p59
aS'1) Honestly, i don\'t think paypal will ever accept bitcoin. Actually paypal has quite good reasons for bitcon not to get adopted too much.2) It\'s hard to predict what will happen in the future. Especially with such a "new" market/system like BTC. But basically i don\'t think this will happen. 3) This basically depends on what your standards are. If you focus on privacy/pseudonymity then BTC is definetly already better than paypal.If you are looking for fast payments with low fees.. paypal is (currently) better in this case. But with paypal you have to trust a company to keep your money.4) Thats why BTC (for me) is better than paypal. I rather pay some higher fees and wait 10-30 mins, but instead i (and only i) am in control of my money.'
p60
aS"There is no point into expecting anything from PayPal other than just offering people a pleasant payment experience. PayPal is nothing more than a platform allowing people to transact with their fiat currencies with certain additional features, and that's really it. PayPal is just one of the plenty financial services allowing people to fully utilize fiat on a global scale, which is something Bitcoin by far can't achieve right now. In order to make Bitcoin be fully usable as currency tool, we'll definitely need Lightning Network. It allows people to bypass current high fees, and also confirmation times - these two aspects are something currently preventing Bitcoin from being fully utilized in that aspect."
p61
aS"No, i don't think so, paypall is somehow against bitcoin but who knows. Maybe in future.Nothing is impossible, but to be honest with you we can't say what will happen to bitcoin in next 3 years. Bitcoin is currency and paypal is service for online payment. Can't compare those two.Read 3."
p62
aS"1) I don't think so, 2) I hope it'll happen but I doubt it will3) Yes it is actually,\xc2\xa0 in bitcoins you are in control with your own wallet, you can't be banned, you can send any amount you want, no need to id verification and etc. 4) BTC obviously, Paypal is prone to hacking and it was a pain in my ass just leaving my money in it because sometimes my pp balance disappears "
p63
aS"For speed of transaction, I think that Litecoin or Ethereum would be better or Paypal will make their own coin. I'm sure that Paypal has the technology to make their own coin and their connections with the Feds and the banks would make it easy for them to change funds around the world. I'm sure that Paypal could even make their own exchange and could disrupt the market. "
p64
aS"I think it will happen sooner, paypal accept bitcoin. Impossible but let's see in the next few years what's going to happen. "
p65
aS'One thing you should know is this\xc2\x96 Bitcoin is Bitcoin, while PayPal is real currencies, for example dollars, euros and the rest of them. When it comes to transaction, I think PayPal is faster than bitcoin because transactions are made with email and are instant, while Bitcoin takes 10 \xc2\x96 60 minutes with priority fees (not instant). And for whether PayPal will accept bitcoin, I don\xc2\x92t think that will ever happen, it will be a spoiler for them. And for which of them is better\xc2\x96 that I can\xc2\x92t really tell, because I like the both of them. But PayPal is widely accepted.'
p66
aS'In September 2014, PayPal announced it would accept Bitcoin via integration with Braintree, and the same month announced partnerships with Coinbase, BitPay and GoCoin. Via the PayPal Payment\xc2\x92s Hub merchants could use customizable APIs to integrate Bitcoin into their shops for digital goods. At the time, it released a video hinting at Bitcoin integration.Whether or not PayPal will pursue a more aggressive Bitcoin policy has yet to be seen.\xc2\xa0 In 2014, weighing in already on Bitcoin currency regulations, the company told the Australian Senate:'
p67
aS'PayPal and bitcoin what a combination that can be happen soon.. We can\xc2\x92t make assumptions on how many years from now but as long as we base this to it\xc2\x92s faster adaptation to the internet markets then a 5 year and beloe this actions may take effect in due time.. I know than bitcoin is better if to be used in PayPal but to have an options with usd is still necessary.. '
p68
aS'In general, bitcoin has no advantage to face to paypal in many side as popularity, trust or conveniences. If paypal accepts bitcoin as a real money and allows user exchage bitcoin through paypal, it will very easy for all people who have difficulties in exchanging because so many countries ban bitcoin as a illegal money. Therefore, i hope in near future (2-3 next years) paypal will accept bitcoin so we can use bitcoin easier.'
p69
aS"I think paypal will accept Bitcoin very soon. For now Paypal still has some sides better than BTC, for example when you use paypal to send money but unfortunately you send it to wrong account but with paypal you still can take it back but with Bitcoin it's impossible to take your money back ). For now, IMO Btc is better than PP cause I can easily exchange Bitcoin into cash but with Paypal it's a little bit more difficult and the fee is really high."
p70
aS'Each money transfer media has its own advantages and disadvantages. as well as Bitcoin and paypal, many people who feel comfortable using bitcoin and some are more comfortable to use paypal. if paypal is true to receive Bitcoin then it will be a major breakthrough, there will be an increase in paypal users because with it then the process of paypal deposit transactions will be more widespread.'
p71
aS"PayPal transactions are instant if you use your balance, so how exactly are the altcoins you mentioned faster in this aspect? Nothing beats in-system transactions. Also, PayPal doesn't need to create its own coin because it's based on fiat to move back and forth within their ecosystem. And even if they did create their own coin, it will never have any actual impact on Bitcoin's market, which basically goes up for governments coming up with their own digital currency as well. Bitcoin's market has its own characteristics that makes people interested in it, and then I'm mainly referring to the growth potential and the fact that there is no central authority in place."
p72
aS'1) No, its not quite possible anytime soon2) Yes but it depends more of on what is the opinion of rest of the world regarding cryptos3) When bitcoin is able to reduce its transaction times and fees. 4) Depends upon the thing you have decided to buy. For legal transactions ofcourse paypal is better. '
p73
aS'I think its posible that paypal accept bitcoin, but PayPal transactions are instant if you use your balance but it depends upon the thing you have decided to buy. For legal transactions ofcourse paypal is better.'
p74
aS"Maybe it'll happen or maybe not. I think we need to wait a little bit more to see what will happen but I think Paypal will accept Bitcoin if there are any country will legalize Bitcoin as their local currency."
p75
aS'Braintree is owned by PayPal so I believe you would have to integrate with them: https://www.braintreepayments.com/ '
p76
aS'I am even still trying to capture my head around why PayPal really need to accept bitcoin. The essence of PayPal is to serve as an intermediary between transactions while connected to your bank.Except if PayPal is going to work in such a way that they can serve as an exchange like some other services like coinbase and Luno in some places already do, then I do not really see why they have to accept bitcoin unless I am missing the point here.'
p77
aS'PayPal doesn\xc2\x92t work with/accept Bitcoin, they will probably be kicking against that. I\xc2\x92m sure they are accepting Payoneer, and someone once told me that you can verify and use your Payoneer debit card to be withdrawing funds from your PayPal wallet. So I believe if you have Bitcoin debit card issued out by companies like Xapo, Bitpay, Coinbase and the rest of them, it might possible to verify them and use them to withdraw money from your PayPal wallet. Not sure about, I\xc2\x92m just saying.'
p78
aS"they're conflict to each other. so I think paypal will not support bitcoin.btw, maybe an altcoin (like utrust) can replace paypal in future"
p79
aS'1-2. Nothing impossible in business3. Will means in future, so if paypal accept bitcoins, means this technology better than paypal. 4. For now, Paypal still better. From some data news, paypal can handle 193 tx/sec average. PayPal handled 6.1 billion transactions in 2016. For Bitcoins which using block technology, for now its can handle about 7 tx/sec only.\xc2\xa0'
p80
aS'I think it will surely happen that PayPal will include bitcoin transaction and storage into it as it is also knowing and will to get a prat of its huge success by looking at its increasing value. PayPal may start accepting bitcoin in coming years as many big companies have already announced their usage and inclement of bitcoin in their services. Bitcoin is still better than PayPal and the is no doubt in this as bitcoin has a value of $7000 now which is too high and it has already reached some new heights now.'
p81
aS'Paypal will never accept BTC, bocz many countries had banned Bitcoin trading.\xc2\xa0 '
p82
aS'But Many countries banned paypal. Maybe someday paypal will accept bitcoins but not in third countries where paypal is banned like - IranIraqSyriaSudan'
p83
aS"In my opinion this case is totally possible. It'll be happened soon when Bitcoin will be legalized worldwide or only in few big countries like US or Germany. But I think it'll take really long time to legalize Bitcoin because of its disadvantages "
p84
aS"Yeah. I agree with you. At now,\xc2\xa0 bitcoin is better than paypal. Braintree (one division of paypal) just took right way. Most of people has choosen to invest to bitcoin for much money. So, paypal must adapted this situation if they won't bankrupt. "
p85
aS"I don't think so because bitcoin itself is an alternate payment method and somehow better than paypal.Although nothing is impossible but the probability of happening this is very very low.Not will be but bitcoin is better than paypal in many ways. I never believe that Paypal is better than bitcoin but for now BTC is not accepted in most of the online stores so paypal is not a bad choice for now."
p86
aS'1. It bound to happen , it might not be bitcoin but the blockchain technology is here to stay and it would be a major boost for paypal should they accept bitcoin payments.3-7 years why not, all paypal needs is probably bitcoin being legalized.its likely going to be unpopular among buyers as transactions are irreversibly Seller= bitcoin is betterBuyer= Paypal is better but should it have some sort of escrow in place bitcoin will be the best!'
p87
aS'In the near future all the big companies will start accepting bitcoin as their payments. It is good that PayPal has started accepting bitcoin as their payments and they are trading in bitcoin because they know the importance of bitcoin and they have realized that bitcoin is the future currency and all the people in the world will use bitcoin as their legal and regular currency for their day to day needs.'
p88
aS'1) I think to realize this will be a bit difficult because paypal I do not think will include a bitcoin payment method2) it seems that in the next 3-10 years this will not happen, but if over 10 years and bitcoin users the stronger paypal will probably consider it ..3) I myself still use bitcoin and have not been interested to use paypal4) to date btc is still the main choice of many people'
p89
aS'It is true the bitcoin is now being support by the people who have invested in the bitcoin and they are trying to make the high profit with the bitcoin in the small investment so I want to say that it is not possible. If you are not willing to have the money and you are interested in buying the bitcoin you should buy the bitcoin and hold for the long time I am sure the bitcoin profit will be high with the time.'
p90
aS"In the future almost every seller/website will accept Bitcoin, it's just inevitable! So yes, also Paypal."
p91
aS"I'm more curious about when Coinbase will start offering dollar transfers like Paypal? That's a much easier transition than going to crypto."
p92
aS'You are right this is the time to increase the value of the bitcoin now it is not impossible because the bitcoin is having the high value and the demand so the bitcoin is now getting famous and the other sites are also approaching the bitcoin. if the paypal will use the bitcoin it will make the bitcoin more famous and off course more people will buy and more companies will use\xc2\xa0 the bitcoin it is the main thing in the bitcoin now.'
p93
aS"1) No, I feel paypal is good with dollars.2) No, I don't think so. I mean its not needed. BTC transaction itself so simple and can be transferred across whole globe.3) IF BTC reduces Fees then it can easily grab Paypal market.4) PP is better coz it legally approved."
p94
aS"I think this is possible to happen that paypal accepts bitcoin just look at bitcoin now paypal will benefits a lot too if they accept bitcoin3-7 years yup it's possible as long as bitcoin is finally recognized by the government and recommend it for mass adoptionYup both bitcoin and paypal will be much better with each otherRight now in terms of transaction i think paypal is still much better but i use bitcoin as my asset so it's good too."
p95
aS'1) No2) No3) Bitcoin is better than PayPal. Because I was once a Victim4) BTC'
p96
aS"Bitcoin 's full legalization will not last long, because it will never be fully legalized. World countries do not yet have a consensus on crypto money, in fact most countries do not even have an idea."
p97
aS"Right, we can just exhange funds with other users for this kind of matter. For those paypal merchant out there, they can just use a payment processor that accepts bitcoin. The problem we are facing right now are the fees and the confirmation times there are times that the network is overloaded with transaction but it's not permanent. Imo bitcoin is better if you are the type of person that doesn't have a credit/debit card. Both bitcoin and paypal has their positives and negatives."
p98
aS'Do you think this is possible? Guys is it?'
p99
aS"Yes bitcoin being accepted by PayPal is possible to happen. We just have to wait for their proper announcement since many will prefer to get into bitcoin since it's an all in all type of currency, investment and at the same time\xc2\xa0 a payment sender and receiver."
p100
aS"- I don't think that Paypal is accepting Bitcoin, but it could be some of the Paypal users are accepting Bitcoin as payment, but I think there are only few of them doing this things.- We don't know what will happen in the next 3 to 7 years from now, but it maybe not or maybe.- Bitcoin 100% is better than paypal because of its volatility, and features it has and very useful usages of bitcoin for the users.- It is still bitcoin was better than PP."
p101
aS'This can be realized if many parties support. Bitcoin is still not able to enter various sectors because there are some regulations that block bitcoin. Examples are government-regulated regulations, to date many governments of a country still dare not support bitcoin. And when bitcoin can get support from various parties then things like that can be realized easily. The possibility of various e-commerce sectors will be able to apply bitcoin very easily. We must work hard and convince the government to be able to open the opportunities that exist.'
p102
aS"Those governments that doesn't want to support bitcoin are afraid of what bitcoin can do to them so instead of supporting it, they are making their own move just to get with what's happening. Like making their own coin and others are just spreading false news so citizens will not invest on it. But if more and more companies starts to accept bitcoin like PayPal, there will be a big change."
p103
aS'No, it is even banning users who uses cryptocurrency with PayPal account.'
p104
aS"They will never have any impact on Bitcoin or other crypto currencies. State issued currencies are always tied to the broken financial system with all its negative aspects. At most people only gain more convenience when using a state issued crypto currency compared to how they used fiat prior to that. Some people here still don't understand that, and for that reason believe that if PayPal or a government issues its own currency, it will make our current crypto's obsolete. They completely ignore why crypto, and especially Bitcoin attracts so much attention, praise and actual usage. It all comes down to a lacking knowledge."
p105
aS"Well in terms in transaction volume with bitcoin 7 transaction per second compared to paypal's 200 transaction per second bitcoin is far behind but bitcoin now a days is not for transactions but more like an asset to store your money for long term profit. Also bitcoin's demand is increasing rapidly it may not be as good as an payment processor but it is a goos investment."
p106
aS"I think it's possible. but for now, there are no signs for it yet. Currently, PayPal has become a bank that is recognized on the internet. while bitcoin, is just an investment tool. maybe paypal can take advantage of bitcoin by considering bitcoin as an investment tool like gold. but, it should be with clear data."
p107
aS"They're totally different systems in my opinion. I don't think it will accept it anytime soon."
p108
aS'This is very good information. Paypal kind of accepts Bitcoin in its own way through Braintree. There will be a time that Bitcoin will need to be an accepted form of payment for all goods and services.'
p109
aS"I am not a huge fan of Paypal and only use them when I definitely have to. I've had a run in with them in the past as a merchant and they were very unfair with the way they handled the situation. They will suspend your account and hold your funds etc without much of an explanation, well at least that was my experience with them a few days ago, I don't know if they've changed the way they operate. I personally wouldn't encourage anyone to store their BTC there if they did provide that option in the future as it would be much too risky."
p110
aS"Yeah Paypal not allowed you to exchange money to Bitcoin through paypal, it's against their ToS. Even though, we have seen in here there are still people exchange Paypal to Bitcoin in this forum."
p111
aS'Regarding on which better for now PP or BTC, PP is more better in daily transaction because paypal has been used for a long time while BTC is much better on transaction such as trading and investment because of its voltality and anonymity. And about if paypal will accept bitcoin next 3-7 years, I think it is possible because bitcoin now is becoming more popular and few of them are prefer to use it in their transaction.'
p112
aS"With a fee of 0.000339 BTC per median transaction size of 226 bytes is hard to believe that bitcoin will be ever used by big companies (eg. McDonald's) for small payments. \xc2\xa0"
p113
aS"I don't think paypal will acept bitcoin, i think it can exist in the future a rival of paypal like bitpal, btcpal, or something just for bitcoins, with a card, payshop deposit etc... I think we are closer to ebay or amazon acept bitcoin..."
p114
aS"It's just a matter of waiting for lightning network to be in public operational condition. When that happens, the currency aspect of Bitcoin will get its use and appreciation that it deserves. It will be an ultimate form of incentive for people to spend their coins, where they now complain that they don't spend any because of the fees and confirmation times. I however doubt that people miraculously will start spending.People will always know that when they spend Bitcoin, that they very likely will miss out on further profits due to this market that doesn't stop with increasing, and honestly speaking, we can't blame them for thinking like that."
p115
aS'Sooner or later, I think Bitcoin will be accepted all over the world if Amazon is really going to accept Bitcoin for payment in there market and Paypal will not be the exception '
p116
aS'only one answer for your 4 questions: forget paypal, just use uphold or airtm.'
p117
aS"Might be. But I think we need to wait a little bit more cause I think Paypal will only accept Bitcoin for payment when Bitcoin legalized in any country all over the world. For now Bitcoin is still not legalized in any country yet so I think at the moment this case is not going to happen but it'll be happened soon."
p118
aS'I think paypal will accept Bitcoin soon when Bitcoin would be legalized in any country. As I think for now Bitcoin is better than Paypal already '
p119
aS'I think Paypal will accept BitcoinBecause Bitcoin and other coins are the future trend.So, Paypal will improve itself to develop'
p120
aS'Bitcoin is better than paypal transaction fees, security and accessibility of your wallet, but if PayPal accept bitcoin transaction i will try and check if it worthy. '
p121
aS"For now, I use Paxful to buy and sell thru PayPal.Here's the linked tutorial that they made: https://kb.paxful.com/knowledgebase/sell-bitcoins-part-iii-creating-offer-incoming-trade/"
p122
aS'As I see PayPal are desperately wants to have a connection to crypto currency to become famous in digital world. Also digital currency now are much healthy condition in the real world so I think they used it by the PayPal to survive in the future.'
p123
aS'First, Bitcoin and PayPal can never be business partners, and there\xc2\x92s a reason for that. PayPal is a payment processor, and was made for the purpose of transaction online with use of various currency. Bitcoin is different, and is not a payment processor. It\xc2\x92s just a virtual currency and it\xc2\x92s own its own, and its price always varies in comparison with real currencies, and it has no stable price rate.But bitcoin offers some nice features like lesser fees for transactions.'
p124
aS'I think soon paypal will also receive Bitcoin. and if paypal working with Bitcoin will be a very profitable cooperation.if compared to paypal with Bitcoin I would say that Bitcoin is superior to Paypal.\xc2\xa0'
p125
aS'They may do in the future like you say.. but is hard to say really, they probably view it as more of a competitor to them at this point'
p126
aS'yeah your right.paypal wont ever accept bitcoin because they are two different things with almost same offer to user.paypal maybe faster than bitcoin transaction but bitcoin has lots to offer.and some PayPal partners are making business to other crypto exchange because they know that bitcoin has a better future than paypal'
p127
aS'Well, PayPal having an exchange is one thing that we may expect later on and I won\xc2\x92t be surprised. They have always had the name and the platform that has been working in years. However, PayPal accepting bitcoin directly is something that I do not really see the necessity as that would be to what extent? Bitcoin is workable with wallet to wallet transaction which totally eliminates PayPal in the equation and except PayPal comes in as an exchange, they are not useful in the bitcoin ecosystem.'
p128
aS'Yes, PayPal and bitcoin function on two entirely different platform. Some feel bitcoin to be good and some for the payback options prefer PayPal. PayPal might get associated with bitcoin in the future when technology makes a big change in the entire growth happening around the globe.'
p129
aS'Well, that is one way to come in by acting as an exchange which they are not the first to do this. I have been using services like Luno in my country to achieve this for a while now and the services have been awesome. However, PayPal coming into the show will actually create awareness as a very large of the global population has been making use of PayPal and the introduction of bitcoin while serving as an exchange will make it even better.'
p130
aS'Well, if they decide to integrate with some of these companies as you have said, that would obviously help enhance the usage of bitcoin by most of these merchants just like bitpay has always been doing. I am pretty sure they understand that they are missing a lot and would want to see how they can tap into it for their benefits coupled with what they have always been doing, so I would not be surprised.'
p131
aS'Why Paypal should accept bitcoin. Bitcoin is the best money transaction medium than any international transfer options. If paypal is there are payment API in any e-store even bitcoin payment API is also can be added that. Bitcoin is the competitor for Paypal and all over money transaction medium. Since many corporates making money as a business in that way so that is the reason they allowing bitcoin to work in the many countries. '
p132
aS'PayPal works with BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin to receive online transactions related to Digital Goods, Digital Goods is the purchase of non-physical goods such as Software, Serial Number, Music, Digital Book, Applications and so forth'
p133
aS"Paypal has lost the old popularity, the number of users has decreased. This is certainly not Bitcoin because Bitcoin appeared in 2009. Paypal was as popular as it was two or three years ago. For this reason, Paypal's joint venture with Bitcoin will bring back the old reputation of Paypal."
p134
aS'forget about itit will never happen'
p135
aS"Isn't it better to remain separate from PayPal and similar payment services?That's one of true values of bitcoin !"
p136
aS"that will never happen paypal accepting bitcoin, paypal are so strict unlike perfectmoney and payza are accepting bitcoin and I'm still using them. Better to use bitcoin than paypal. "
p137
aS"Not necessarily. At the end of the day, services are free to incorporate Bitcoin in the way they want, and there isn't anyone or anything preventing them from doing so, which I am very happy with. Bitcoin is freedom and doesn't discriminate like PayPal & Co are doing. Services incorporating Bitcoin increases Bitcoin's utility, which is something we all strive for, right? Best thing of all is that we still have the choice to make use of something or not - no one forces us to use something we don't want. Ultimately, I honestly don't see much reason for PayPal to ever incorporate Bitcoin. They are growing every quarter of the year consistently for quite some time now, and it doesn't look like it will stop. So regardless of what we think of PayPal, they are marketing themselves very well, which translates into long term growth."
p138
aS'In my opinion, if PayPal accept bitcoin for the next years coming, I think that PayPal is not strong enough to supports the needed of their company, even though their corporation is established steadily. Moreover it is desperately move to PayPal because they want to joint forces with the crypto currency.In addition all of us knows that bitcoin are starting to become famous and sooner or later they can surpass PayPal in the market.'
p139
aS'Why do we need to have paypal connected to bitcoin and do such things if Bitcoin can stand alone and do it by itself?what can paypal do well bitcoin can also, its just a matter of transfer let bitcoin alone because if we will have paypal on bitcoin another fee will be lessen top our budget.'
p140
aS'Paypal accepts bitcoin or not it should not matter, because the major advantage of paypal was that it was used to transfer money in online fashion to people around the world. Now bitcoin is also a type of crypto currency which is being used world wide to do the online payments. Moreover Paypal has some limits for some countries while bitcoin is available almost all of the countries of the world where internet is available.'
p141
aS"I don't know if paypal can accept Bitcoin next year, as I know, paypal is a financial services company offering electronic payment transaction services while Bitcoin is not a company but a peer-to-peer network in transactions for which operate without central authority developed open source."
p142
aS'\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 For me,bitcoin is better than paypal. Bitcoin is the famous currency at this moment and time will come paypal will accept bitcoin because of its popularity and most of the people nowadays are use bitcoin.'
p143
aS"Regardless of Bitcoin's decentralized nature, any service can implement Bitcoin into its platform if they wish to do so. If lightning network moves out of beta and will be accessible to the public, we don't any major incorporation to implement Bitcoin to gain more traction. People will experience for themselves how it is to not worry about fees and confirmations anymore. I honestly don't really care about PayPal. I am not interested in making use of Bitcoin through a corporation-centralized platform when I can use Bitcoin without the need of any central entity already. It's just me directly paying to person x instead of me sending Bitcoin to corporation, from where the corporation sends the coins to person x. No thanks."
p144
aS"Bitcoin is already better than paypal. If they don't want to accept it, it's their loss and not ours."

aS'Absolutely I agree with you. If paypal accept bitcoin, i think it wil create a big benefits for many countries. As you know, although bitcoin is much more popular, some countries ban or don\xc2\x92t accept this digital currencies like China, there are many people invest BTC, but the government have just not accepted it. So I also hope in the next few years, paypal will accept BTC to every of us get an easy way to exchange.'
p146
aS"as we can see paypal is very famous as it is already known at the industry but look at the bitcoin it is just new but there are a lot of people using it.It's better to try the new products like bitcoin as it will offer better than the existing one as they are promoting it.."
p147
aS'Well, at persent bitcoin - or other cryptocurrencies - are sawn as "concurrents".But I think that in the next future paypal, banks, govermente, and so on, will be forced to accept bitcoin.We\'ll see.'
p148
aS"For now I think we can't ensure anything if Paypal will accept Bitcoin or not. I think we need to wait a little bit more, when Bitcoin legalized in at least 1 or 2 countries all over the world, I believe that Paypal will not be the only one that accept Bitcoin, a lot of other online market will also accept Bitcoin for payment as well."
p149
aS'I dont think that bitcoin is better than paypal and also gold. Bitcoin is bitcoin and paypal is paypal.. they have very different thing how it can not be compared since they are different at all. '
p150
aS'Well if we talk about fiat\xc2\xa0 and crypto market or Bitcoin future I see two possible ways.First crypto overtake fiat currencies, second fiat currencies convert to crypto.There is no doubt that Paypal and many others accept Bitcoin.'
p151
aS'Some traders on Paxful.com uses Paypal to trade in BTC, Its really convenient.'
p152
aS"I can't see any wrong in accepting bitcoin of PayPal, maybe accepting bitcoin for PayPal is not a big deal. Otherwise if PayPal and bitcoin combined together I think more opportunities will be open to many people, other than that it PayPal give bitcoin a chance to become more famous and popular to many users and capitalist."
p153
aS'as i know right now paypal is accept credit card for deposit the money in paypal, but maybe its possible some day that you can use paypal to withdraw your bitcoin, its mean that you can convert your bitcoin into paypal balance and you can withdraw your paypal balance into bank account, but i think it will takes many fees '
p154
aS"Bitcoin is better then PayPal and thats why PayPal is losing battle against bitcoin. Paypal is payment processor, u use PayPal as third party service to move your fiat money, bitcoin is doing that by itself. Question is why bitcoin needs PayPal? How can PayPal help bitcoin? I know answers on this questions and I know that PayPal will be useful one day. Bitcoin doesn't need third party services to move them and store them."
p155
aS"They probably will in the future.Although, when they will, btc will lose its purpose. They wouldn't let it be anonymous."
p156
aS'I think it is true and it will happen soon. But one thing is really noticeable and that is that bitcoin is digital currency and paypal is real. It is just like other real currencies such as fiat cash, dollar and Euros. If we talk about transaction then transaction of paypal is faster than bitcoin but bitcoin will take more than 40 minutes but it is being recover now people are working on it and soon this problem will be solved.'
p157
aS"It's very much a possibility. I'm sure PayPal, Amazon and the likes will have no other choice but to open doors for acceptance of Bitcoin and perhaps other digital assets. Bitcoin and Blockchain is gradually going mainstream. "
p158
aS"PayPal (if they will ever accept Bitcoin) will be nothing more than an optional service that people can make use of. If you don't want to use PayPal you don't have to, and honestly, why would you ever want to use a centralized service anyway nowadays? People (mostly faucet and bounty farmers) were solely using these services to obtain free external transactions, but now they have cut that out, there is no reason left to make use of these services anymore. Imagine what these services will go through once Lightning Network makes them even more obsolete than they already are. Bitcoin will never lose its purpose as long as you have the ability to transact on a peer to peer basis. "
p159
aS' Paypal is optional that people cant service because people solely using these services to obtain free external transactions.'
p160
aS'Now we have an option in PayPal that we can send the payments to PayPal. In my country I cannot directly withdraw the Bitcoin to my Fiat currency. I have a verified PayPal account it is possible to convert Bitcoin to PayPal currency.'
p161
aS'Yes you can use your credit card or debit card to add some funds to your PayPal account/wallet. So that means if you have, for example, a Xapo debit card, you can also use it to credit your PayPal account. With Bitcoin debit cards like that of Xapo, you can do a lot of things with your Bitcoin, including buying in stores where credit cards are accepted. Next, as for whether Bitcoin will be better than PayPal, I don\xc2\x92t think so, PayPal is more accepted than Bitcoin. But Bitcoin and PayPal can work together in a way, just as I described above in the using your Xapo debit card to credit PayPal.'
p162
aS'So, are you paying anything to paypal and to your government when you convert the money from bitcoin to your local currency? Please tell us more about it as I have read that if you convert your bitcoin to your local currency via PayPal, then you have to pay to exchange, and then the PayPal authorities and then the local authorities of your country about the money. If it is correct, then I think we need to find some alternative way.'
p163
aS'In the future, I hope Paypal will be the intermediary to accept payments Bitcoin because they can see the limitations of Bitcoin at the present time that is if moving the wrong address, is sure to lose all of Bitcoin has moved. I hope Paypal accept Bitcoin and will be the intermediary to transfer the money to the different addresses, in case of mistake will be able to regain some Bitcoin moved. But there is a disadvantage that the cost per transaction will be higher than at present, but to avoid the risk then I saw the intermediary Paypal stands out in every Bitcoin transaction would be perfectly reasonable. '
p164
aS"maybe someday because of the bitcoin popularity increased maybe someday paypal will accept bitcoin as the payment and maybe we can do some trading in Paypal, bitcoin is better than paypal? i think both of them have a advantages and disadvantages too so we can't tell about who is the most better currencies"
p165
aS'I think so PayPal is the most authentic and reliable source of transferring money. Most of the online jobs companies pay with PayPal. But in most countries the PayPal services are not available and the people face difficulties in their payments. If PayPal start accepting bitcoin then most people in different countries will benefit from it. I will really appreciate this because it is the need of the day.'
p166
aS"1. Yes2. This is possible, paypal is a well known payment processor and they want to take it as an advantage instead of competing against bitcoin.3. I think bitcoin can be better than paypal but I don't know when it will happen.4. For now, both has high fees so I can't decide."
p167
aS'Paypal can accept bitcoin indirectly like accept card using bitcoin or accept something like payeer.in future may be find bitcoin used more than paypal'
p168
aS'PayPal better or Bitcoin better will depend on ther users. If person want annoymity over safty over his payment he will choose BTC. If someone wants safty of their payment, ability to charge back etc, he will like PayPal.'
p169
aS"My Ideas about four questions.1) defeneedly I think so. In next year I will hope to hear that news.2) yes. I hope paypal will accept because a lot of people use BTC right now.3) BTC is the best. Because if paypal use, we need physical currency. But BTC is direct digital currency.4) we can't earn more money using paypal. only spend money using paypal but we can earn money by trading BTC. "
p170
aS'It think paypal is being use more than bitcoin and it is could currency today now paypal is a payment and it might be associated with bitcoin now bitcoin is being support by paypal and it has gained the support of worldwide and increase more if bitcoin will be invested by a lot of people with paypal investors. So no doubt we will see many websites including paypal will accept bitcoin.'
p171
aS'PayPal is totally different concept and bitcoin is crypto currency. Whether PayPal increases or decreases it\xc2\x92s none of our business. Now if we draw a comparison, the first thing is that PayPal is not totally online and in some parts of the world, its not even considered the currency. Where as crypto currency is slowly taking over the online system and I think in near future, it will takeover the all online money transfers platforms.'
p172
aS'I heard that PayPal are ready to accept and join forces with crypto currency, but I think it will not happen for now, maybe it takes time before finalize and establish that partnership of 2 big companies. In my opinion it gives a lot of opportunity if this partnership will become successful but not for now they need to study it carefully.'
p173
aS"PayPal does have some disadvantage for both users, receivers and senders. Someone can dispute the transaction base on his own will and it will all depend on how PayPal will take bitcoin seriously. I have read some rumors if that's right that they are already taking a look at bitcoin."
p174
aS"Would be really interesting to see if it would ever happen but unfortunately the current trend is more places are dropping Bitcoin than picking it up due to the fee's and confirmation times so it would be going against the trend. There is definitely a future in Bitcoin but with the sort of congestion we are seeing it just means more alt coins like Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin etc will be advantageous to use for this purpose. Paypal also pretty much have a monopoly on the fiat transfer market so there is room for more competition. I know of at least a few businesses similar to paypal that accept crypto currency so it will be interesting to see if they become more widely accepted."
p175
aS'No man, why the hell would anyone use PayPal with bitcoin, it loses its purpose.PayPal - centralizedBitcoin - decentralizedPayPal- reversibleBitcoin - irreversiblePayPal- elgible to get your funds seizedBitcoin - not elgible for that'
p176
aS"I do not understand Why many people generally put such questions, regarding Bitcoin and such a payment system as PayPal. After all, these are practically two different things that lie in different planes of the world's financial pyramids. In short, there is nothing in common here and I fully agree with your examples."
p177
aS'i think paypal is better for now BTC still have limit maybe 2 years from now BTC will be better'
p178
aS"For Paypal Bitcoin is one their major competitor in terms of online transaction payment, time will come and we just don't know when will happen but for sure they will accept bitcoin in the end where they can't do anything to defeat bitcoin. So in the last they will join the trend for sure."
p179
aS'well if i were to compare paypal from btc, i would choose the bitcoin of course. Aside from its amazing features, it is already international and has the potential to burst in the next year. '
p180
aS'I think bitcoin will be higher in price compared to paypal, see the development of bitcoin users is currently growing, now bitcoin already worth above $ 14000'
p181
aS'This is interesting news, because PayPal is world leading money exchange company and many companies pay to their foreign workers through PayPal. It will be easy for all the users of PayPal to receive their payments direct to their bitcoin wallet. For PayPal it is also convenient to pay in bitcoin. It seems that now the world is gradually turning towards accepting and using bitcoin all over the world which is a good sign.'
p182
aS"Correct, I'm sure most of the bitcoin users were also used PayPal. Transferring of amount from bitcoin to PayPal will become more easier that before. Also all transactions thru PayPal would be much easier to do thru help of bitcoin.It's a good start if it is happen in this 2018."
p183
aS'There is a possibility that Paypal will accept bitcoin. If everyone is aware of the cryptocurrency like bitcoin why would they not let it happen. It is just a matter of years for everyone to know about cryptocurrencies. '
p184
aS'Yeah I submit your thoughts. I also appreciate PayPal step towards accepting bitcoin as regular money. Every company in the world wants to give ease to hos clients and PayPal is doing the same. By this way their scope in the world market of online payments will grow more because when you want to exchange your bitcoin in your local one PayPal will help you in this regard.'
p185
aS'All the people users of PayPal will benefited from this step of bitcoin. I really appreciate this and by this way many other money exchange service provider companies will also follow PayPal and will start accepting bitcoin. Payments will be easier for them and also for the companies who wants to pay you in bitcoin. It means all the circle of payments and receiving will feel ease and comfort in this way.'
p186
aS'That possibility is totally big, PayPal is a popular payment processor and others are starting to shift their payment method through bitcoin which is very popular nowadays. They can send and receive bitcoin in the quickest way as there are too many exchanges that are already running and everyone can exchange bitcoins -> USD in the easiest way which is the main concern of people who are using PayPal.'
p187
aS"As of now paypal doesn't accept bitcoin but there is posibilities that sooner they are going to accept bitcoin money for the good transaction. You don't know the technologies now a days it is going fast. If they are going to study the streghts and weaknesses of bitcoin they will easily identify the methods and process of the transaction because Paypal is very famous payment services. "
p188
aS'No other currencies is not as more powerful than bitcoin till now , PayPal do not accept bitcoin till today , in future it will be possible but bitcoin is considered as better currency than other currencies by people it will be very healthy thing for bitcoin users and investors .'
p189
aS"It really is hard to figure out. 1. They hate cryptocurrencies so they won't accept Bitcoin or any other coin except if they are the ones who developed it.2. They love/hate Bitcoin but want a piece of the Bitcoin pie so that they can somehow control it."
p190
aS'Use Paxful.com! They accept Paypal'
p191
aS"No, paypal knows what is right for their company and look at what Steam did after accepting btc. It's so volatile so they dropped it. But I bet UTRUST will replace paypal."
p192
aS"It's a really hard choice for Paypal.As the founder of the Internet Payment,it wanna hug the BTC and BlockChain fiercely.But on the other way,Paypal knows that every action it takes will influence the whole payment area and would cause gov's supervision!!It's dilemma,really,really hard!"
p193
aS"I think Paypal needn't to implement Bitcoin because It act with certain purpose. Paypal is development\xc2\xa0 with its way year by year .\xc2\xa0 I'm sure most of the bitcoin users were also used PayPal PayPal is seeing its user base grow continuously year after year, so it's safe to say that they market themselves very well, and that there is a decent amount of demand for their platform. It's not a shocking growth they experience, but it's at least consistent.PayPal is a popular payment processor"
p194
aS"PayPal makes money from the spread it earns.\xc2\xa0 In other words, it charges merchants 3% to accept it as a form of payment, and if that Paypal account is funded with ACH, then it only costs PayPal about .25% to fund that transaction, so the spread to PayPal ois 2.75%If a credit card is used to fund that transaction, it costs PayPal about 2.2%, so the spreaad to PayPal is just 0.8%.\xc2\xa0 I'm not sure how much it would cost PayPal to use BTC as the funding mechanism, but if you figured that out, then you'd have the answer.\xc2\xa0 PayPal is fundamentally a spread business and the cheaper the funding, the bigger the profit it will make on anygiven transaction. "
p195
aS'Paypal would have to change for it to compete. Utrust will compete with it and maybe upend the payments industry if successful.'
p196
aS"1) Do you think about this news will happen ? No, this is not going to happen.2) Do you think paypal may accept bitcoin in next years (3-7) or it is impossible ? No, it's impossible.3) Do you think bitcoin will be better than paypal ? when will happen ? There is a huge difference. BTC is a cyrptocurrency and payment method while PP is a sole payment provider that enables you to use bank account/credit card with one click simplification. I.e. closing of PP doesn't mean anything while the collapse of BTC will hurt everyone here so badly. BTC is a revolution while PP is only a way for spending funds from your bank account/credit card.4) which better for now PP or BTC ? For ordering Pizza or booking your flight, generally for all non-virtual goods, you can use PayPal. For irreversible payments for your virtual goods or for any kind of arrangements around the globe BTC offers you a unique solution."
p197
aS"It wont going to happen, Paypal wont going to accept bitcoins, its also against Paypal's terms. "
p198
aS"I think Paypal will just create their own tokens just like what Kodak did. It would favor their business more compared than doing it with bitcoins. Bitcoins is still a headache for fees and transaction time so I still don't see any possibilities."
p199
aS"Definitely, to stay the leading payment processor, if BTC gains enough popularity, they will have to accept it to keep running.They might also make the extra transaction fees which means extra profits so there's nothing to lose so why not?Only thing stopping them right now is the instability and the complications of buying and selling, once it becomes mainstream, these problems would disappear and it would be a lot more easier."
p200
aS'There is no transaction connection between PayPal and bitcoin till now if it is possible the people easy to transact their bitcoin easily I think soon it is will be possible and it also make some good improvement in crypto currencies .'
p201
aS'Both might look like providing the same service, but they are completely operational in different platform. Maybe soon or later bitcoin and PayPal will function in a collaborative manner when the growth becomes promising, more marketplace as well more adoption from common users add value to cryptocurrency.'
p202
aS"it's hard to know what will going on,it's could be happen by see the development of bitcoin and paypal now but takes a long time ,i think the both have great the potential and interest to work together in the future,hopefully so"
p203
aS"1. Totally possible. Lots of people are requesting PayPal to do so.2. It's not impossible but you never know what PayPal has got in mind.3. Bitcoin is better than PayPal. Though they are on entirely different backgrounds and users. Bitcoin is a currency, whereas PayPal is a medium of exchange.4. Depends on where you want to use it.I know a lot of people would have said the same things already but I wanted to have my say in it.\xc2\xa0 "
p204
aS'No, you are only seeing that from our perspective, paypal needs to deal with the US tax authorities and they are the most powerful of all the tax authorities, if they accepted bitcoin they will have to implement harsher KYC policies, and they will close your account for any transgression also the amount of bitcoin users is not that big so the costs will outweigh the benefits.'
p205
aS"I agree with you that PayPal never accept bitcoin because it's a different coin and bitcoin better than PayPal to me although actually i don't know much about PayPal."
p206
aS'Well I believe soon PayPal and other payments gateways will definitely accept btc'
p207
aS"\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes accept cash payments for bitcoin online process.theie are accept to the business related to bank account details in acceping to bitcoin.the paypal can offer the option to pay with bitcoin the bitcoin users won't be able to integrate wallets with their paypal account.this also bitcoin payment to good through the online investment.the payple of wallet to currency for online transaction you can virtual world exchange or your credit card to exchange paypal to bitcoin."
p208
aS"This can happen as there are companies that are already considering bitcoin as a payment method and it can be a big competition with PayPal.Just like what others are saying that if you can't beat them join them. I know that PayPal's management understand that bitcoin is going to be a big threat into their business in the future.Where everyone actually like cryptocurrencies and are all fully depending on it."
p209
aS'Eehm\xc2\x85 it\xc2\x92s like we are all confused here. First, PayPal is a payment processor which can be used to make payment in online stores and various other places, including offline. PayPal is not an exchanger site or forex site, so why on Earth should we be expecting them to start accepting Bitcoin; I mean for what reason? Cos this is making no sense at all.'
p210
aS'Paypal is the direct competitor of Bitcoin so not a chance in hell. Bitcoin is designed to be peer-to-peer effectively making PayPal services absolutely redundant if it became mainstream. '
p211
aS'This may happen in the future maybe even bigger news will come and bigger companies will accepts bitcoins as a legal payment for their service,but looking at it right now seems impossible since bitcoins potential is not enough to work with this such big things'
p212
aS"1) Of course it will happen, in my opinion everyone will accept bitcoin once it will be popular enough.2) It might need up to 10 years for that, depends on how many people will actually want to use bitcoins as a currency.3) It will be better because of smaller fees and privacy.4. Currently paypal is better because you can't use bitcoin to pay anywhere, i hope it will change soon "
p213
aS"1- No. Because BTC and PP are 2 competitor payment processors.2- It's impossible, will never happen.3- Bitcoin is already better. However altcoins are better than BTC in lower transaction fees and faster confirmations. 4- For now BTC is better. BTC is a newer technology than PP. Altcoins are newer than BTC."
p214
aS"Altcoins have lower overall transaction fees because their network doesn't experience much usage (if any at all). It's not that long ago where people were referring to Ethereum as being the Bitcoin killer, but yet it failed miserably in that aspect. Due to an insane amount of usage, its fees have shot up significantly, and its network experienced various major difficulties. No chance.What is that for logic? It all depends on how and in what scenario you use one of these two options. PayPal functions very well as platform for people to transact with each other, buy stuff, etc. Bitcoin severely lacks in that aspect. Bitcoin is better in other aspects, but not in the aspects PayPal enjoys most of its usage."
p215
aS"Very possible to happen, not only considering PayPal but as well as facebook,youtube, google and other any popular websites and services.It's because there's still a big debate on what coin to support for miners but if everyone of us will be only supporting one coin and bitcoin only marketplace this is going to happen in no time."
p216
aS"It is impossible for paypal to accept bitcoins at the current state of crypto currencies.Currently, bitcoin and other digital assets are unregulated, as long as they remain unregulated,it will be impossible for regulated companies to keep it(there is a difference between accepting bitcoins through a 3rd company such as bitpay, which converts the bitcoins at the payment time, and between accepting bitcoins and keeping them, which shows that you believe in the currency for the long term).Paypal can't touch bitcoin as long as it remains unregulated, we need to lead a regulation if we want paypal to consider accepting bitcoins as a sort of deposit."
p217
aS"You have a point there. But if PayPal will not welcome change especially now that cryptocurrencies are starting to have their own niche in the digital world, they will be left behind. Though if you will think of it, bitcoin is one of their competitors with how transactions are made. But I think later on, they will be integrating bitcoin. But how? I don't know the answer yet... It's just like banks vs. bitcoin, now, banks are starting to accept bitcoin deposits, and starting to utilize the blockchain in their operations."
p218
aS'If you say facebook, google or even ebay accept bitcoin i will agree with you. Paypal will never accept bitcoin because paypal is forbidden exchange other virtual currency in the rule of paypal.At the moment, I see paypal is still better bitcoin because paypal is accepting anywhere but in the future bitcoin will better '
p219
aS'In the global marketplace, rivalries can be friendly for a day, there are many examples. Apple and Samsung look like competitors, they can act jointly. But I think Paypal is a finished company.'
p220
aS'would be great for paypal if receiving bitcoin. but, I think paypal will not accept bitcoin. well, basically paypal is a bitcoin rival, and is the most trusted dollar depository on the internet. I think it will happen for a very long time'
p221
aS'I think Paypal will never accept bitcoins, cause then will be so many issues with refunds. Thats my opinion. '
p222
aS'i think paypal never accept bitcoin now or in future , for me bitcoin better than paypal . fast and easy for exchange and small fee but for shopping paypal better '
p223
aS'Eventually it will but we need a push and more advertising to bitcoin for PayPal to knows the demand of its clients.That\xc2\x92s is precisely possible but a 3 years from now is too early a 5-7 years might be the date.You mean usd than bitcoin, if yes then I\xc2\x92m sure with that. Bitcoin is way more better than a fiat currency that is controlled by corrupt system.I do use both but minimally on PayPal, I\xc2\x92m more of a bitcoin user now. I\xc2\x92m more feel freedom using cryptocurrency than a much detailed transaction with PayPal that must be legally binding.'
p224
aS'When banks start to accept BTC, PayPal will follow'
p225
aS'bitcoin is the strongest today and hunted and used very much\xc2\xa0 as a means of payment online can even be received in various currency exchange in various countries. bitcoin has exceeded paypal'
p226
aS'Paypal is legalized worlwide company wich provides fiat service to exchange and pay to any product with safety to seller and buyer. Bitcoin for other side isaccepted worlwide for a few people, most merchants avoid it, and isnt legalized, only Japan has legalized it. Currently at some point bitcoin transactions are becoming more expensive then paypal, soo its possible into the future bitcoin becames legalized and accepted into paypal, but the run of low fees transactions bitcoin will loose to paypal.'
p227
aS'1) No it will not, because Paypal hates bitcoins and they do not work well together. There is no reason why paypal would accept it in the near future.2) Again, no. It is impossible. 3) It is already. Paypal is not good for the sellers since chargebacks are quite easy to do. However, bitcoins are good for sellers and bad for buyers since the transaction is irreversible. It would be hard to compel the seller to give back the money. This could be mitigated though if there would be an escrow.4) BTC of course.'
p228
aS"Bitcoin at this point has only surpassed PayPal in terms of value moved from one place to another, and that's really it. It mainly comes from the fact that Bitcoin's price has literally exploded in value this year.Aside from that one thing, PayPal is still leading over Bitcoin. PayPal stimulates people to spend money due to the convenience and usability that it offers, where we have to keep its world wide acceptance in mind as well.Being a Bitcoin enthusiast is fine and all, but there is no need to exaggerate its current reach. Bitcoin has a lot of catching up to do, and that will take some time. And even if it did, the volatility plays an important role as well."
p229
aS"They will at some point and yes they are quite dependent to the banks. It's quite early for now to assume that PayPal will accept bitcoin but there are good speculations out there that there is really a possibility.Will try them out if they are now into bitcoin but so far I think they are still studying on how they can adjust their service together with bitcoin."

p1
aS'Hi and welcome!I can suggest you to have a look over http://all4btc.com/ , it works the same as purse.io , and their system works good and protects the buys as it should protect them.Anyway I would suggest you to avoid using sites like this, and use them only if you have to, and never buy any important thing( such as flight tickets) or something like that, because some people use a stolen credit card and you will end up having troubles with the company that issued the tickets( as the tickets are assigned to you and they have all the details about you).Buy with caution!'
p2
aS'Like purse.io site there are plenty sites in online. Hope you looking to e-commerce which accepting bitcoin as a payment. For instance you can check the below link to find the many sites in this.https://www.lifewire.com/big-sites-that-accept-bitcoin-payments-3485965I like overstock.com site which helps the payment API bitpay integrated in that. Bestie site among all the site is the purse. You will get the credit points more so you can get the certain discount with that credit points.'

S"S yesterday I've made a tx and blockchain.info gave me a min fee of 5sat/b apparently so I thought nothing of it since the fee has been constantly going down that day but it looks like the fee jumped and now the tx is stuck and viabtc isn't working anymore. Are there any transaction accereleration services that I may use?"
p1
aS'Did you send the BTC from blockchain.info to another Bitcoin wallet that you control? Then CPFP (Child Pays for Parent) may be an easy method to get your transaction confirmed. This trick unfortunately only works if you are in control of the recipient address. If you sentyour coins from blockchain.info to an exchange or a gambling site this won\xc2\xb4t help you.Irrespective of this I think that you will get a confirmation eventually, because the mempoolonly contains 39k transactions as of now and some of these probably have an even lower feethan 5sat/b. '
p2
aS"No matter how down the fees get, paying 5sat/B is still not recommended if you want your transaction to get confirmed earlier. Miners don't include transactions with micro fees to their blocks and it causes the transactions to get stuck for a very long time. I think it is better to pay the recommended fees than paying a accelerator service to push the transaction. Anyway, you should try https://pushtx.btc.com/ or http://confirmtx.com/. Maybe one of them can do the work for you."
p3
aS'How about this list? FREE BTC Tx Accelerators. Stop paying for something that is free!'
p4
aS"Don't worry, coins are not getting lost.First of all, I would recommend you to use other wallet then blockchain.info, as this wallet is cloud based and is not safer as a desktop wallet or an hardware wallet.If you are still choosing to use it, make sure that you update the fee settings so you won't broadcast any low fee transactions anymore.Bitcoins are not getting lost, it's either they are getting delivered to the destination(in this case, the address that you sent them to), or they are not getting confirmed at all and they are getting returned to the origin wallet.At both cases, you are not going to lose anything at all."
p5
aS"Blockchain.info's wallet recommends me the same amount of regular fee on my bitcoin transaction yesterday. I knew it wasn't accurate after I check bitcoinfees.21.co and used custom fees so I can increase the fees to 30sat/byte. I already learned my lesson not to trust the recommended fees from blockchain as they won't be accurate most of the time."

p1
aS'You can also enable 2FA for withdrawal If there is the option to do so. I know that Hitbtc have it but even with the email address only, that should be safe. Another method would be to build something using their API and limit the use for trading only.'

aS"They shouldn't be able to because most of the exchanges I use usually ask for confirmation through email so even If they type their addresses etc. they can't confirm the withdrawal without having access to your email."
p4
aS'Unless you will press the confirm button mistakenly or accidentally when they tried to withdraw and you confirm it by yourself.'
p5
aS'I don\'t have yet account at Binance, but on the exchange I\'ve been using, they were asked for the same 2FA as for login, and this would make the 2FA useless for OPs purpose.And for OP, since the change you\'ll gave proper 2FA on that account is small, be prepared that somebody (hacker) will find a way to get some of that money of yours.Also, if the "apprentice" traders can find some coins with very low volumes at Binance, they may even use them to make some "bad trades" with your money, by either buying from themselves some coins way overpriced, either selling to themselves some coins way underpriced. This is an indirect withdrawal and you may fail to prevent it.'
p6
aS"Depends on the kind of exchange you're logged into.My local exchange allows me to lock withdrawls using 2FA and sms lock but I don't think Binance and other popular exchanges allow that. So, you can look up for one, see if it's safe and then start using it for your purposes and share its details with the user you want to allow trading without the worry of him withdrawing your money."
p7
aS'This should really be always be checked first regarding on sites features when it comes to withdrawal if they do have any confirmation or not because we would able to find out if someone can able to make withdrawals or not. Seeing on the situation of op seems like email confirmation would be needed to confirm such withdrawal which means as long that confirmation link wont be clicked then no one would able to withdraw funds no matter what.'
p8
aS'That can be enough to not allow them to withdraw the money, but I just have one question why are you doing this, they can trade in paper, you decide to give to them an amount of bitcoin to start and then they create trades in a piece of paper keeping track of the prices that way, then they can close their position anytime by selling in paper this is a great way to learn without having to risk any money at all.'

I didn't know where to post this, but this is about earning money and marketplace is the best place for that.https://nitrogensports.eu/blog/nitro-chat-got-a-bit-crazy/ here you can find more information about requirements.One guy already did it and post his work on youtube, take a look.https://youtu.be/55tRbm5YBWYThis is funny for me, I don't have tattoos and I don't think about making one now, what is about you? Who would do this from here for 1000 dollars? If you wish to do it hurry up just 9 more spots left."
p1
aS':-) maybe the funniest news about BTC ever heard...'
p2
aS"It's crazy offer  Kudos to marketing of Nitrogensports. I don't have any tatoos and I'm not planning to make it, but I like their idea. It's easy money. Considering that prices of tatoos are not expensive, some guys can make really nice money. "
p3
aS'That sounds an easy money. Consedering that I dont have any tattoos on my body, would I get additional Btc for putting Nitrogen sports as the first tattoo on my body? LolIm just asking, my whole career would be in danger if I lay a single tattoo. But, who knows I might get Interested lol\xc2\xa0    '
p4
aS'The things that people will do for a thousand bucks... The great thing about this is that there is no requirement of bodily placement set by the challenger, and the size has to be just a minimum of a US-sized quarter. I have a friend that got a MySpace logo tattoo for a hundred bucks on his arm. He stated that he didn\'t care because he actually enjoyed MySpace and that it was going to be around forever... I wonder what he covered up the tattoo with haha.But this Nitrogen Sports "promo" (if you will) is pretty ingenious! I can\'t wait to see the videos that are procured from this challenge, and honestly, it was enough to get me to sign up for an account on the site just so I can follow the chat there... so obviously, it\'s working lol.OP, maybe you should tell N [2] to officially open an announcement thread here for a bounty so that we can all follow the progress '
p5
aS"It's already over 9 spots was taken fast the promo only lasted for a day or less I think. The guy who won the extra 0.3 btc was the guy who had the tattoo on his belly it was well deserved since it's not that easy to put a tattoo on yourself.The announcement for the winners was posted on twitter. https://twitter.com/NitrogenSports/status/956890789329670146"
p6
aS'Haaaa! That was well deserved! The effort, difficulty, and creativity deserves more than 0.1btc and 0.003btc combined. Congrats to the winners. '
p7
aS'I was on Nitro when N2 was in the chat, and it was crazy.\xc2\xa0 For most of the time I thought N2 was just joking about the tattoo... as for me.... $1000 wouldnt cut it, but for 0.4 BTC.... Ummm... N2 did hook a lot of people up though.\xc2\xa0 I got a bunch of free bets and am very grateful to him, since I did good at them.\xc2\xa0 Plus it was an amazing and fun time for me in chat.'
p8
aS'This is definitely an ingenious idea, they are surely creating a lot of noise with this news in fact I will not be surprised if this was featured in some major news outlets, after all they love this kind of stuff, I will never put a tattoo in my body however I appreciate the art and the effort that goes into creating a beautiful tattoo and I also appreciate the effort put into creating this marketing campaign which is the most amazing I have seen in bitcoin.'
p9
aS'What a crazy way of marketing getting the body inked with NITROGEN SPORTS. Well if I have to do it I would obviously do with my business rather than implementing somebody else business logo on my body. Why will any one like to have it for lifetime that tattoo is what I am thinking about?'
p10
aS"1000 for a tatoo on your body is really something that can change you. Most professional works does not accept their employies with tatooes on their body but, considering 1000 USD it's a big and easy money for that kind of task. This is one of the craziest thing i've heard here for a very long time. This is really a crazy way to market their service."
p11
aS"I'm pretty split on this. On one hand, sure it's just a tattoo and a thousand bucks is a lot of money for some, but on the other hand it's a permanent marker of a gambling site on your body. Depending on where it is, it can easily affect your job and placement opportunities.Usually, when people get tattoos I hear that they get something that means something to them. They don't just put random things permanently on their bodies. This seems like a mistake waiting to happen especially because there are going to be people who tattoo themselves after the first 10 get paid. They end up losing money on this weird promo.I guess if people want to do it, they should go for it, but I just feel weird about this whole scene."
p12
aS"Great job at creating buzz Nitrogen!\xc2\xa0 N2 you rock!\xc2\xa0 I've always loved new marketing ideas, and this truly was unique.\xc2\xa0 Its definitely generated a lot of buzz for them which is impressive.\xc2\xa0 Plus the tattoo artist that won 0.1+0.3btc got to show off his skills and may get more business.\xc2\xa0 A win win for everyone.\xc2\xa0 I liked his artwork too so maybe its time for me to visit him and get my own tattoo...lol"
p13
aS'Its always been part of marketing indeed which it is somehow unique and this is my first time to see this where they do give btc on making some tatoos on sites name. Very nice gimmick though but i wont tend to tatoo myself just for the sake of 0.1 btc.  This would really be a good opportunity for those tatoo artist out there. 9 spots is commendable though.'
p14
aS"In as much as this is going to be fun, I still don't see any sense of purpose on this and what objective they seek to achieve going this kind of promotion for their business. There are several things to be tried in promotion but not this. I personally cannot even pierce my body to the extent of now engraving something related to gambling because of the money involved. They actually know a lot of people would take up the challenge though."
p15
aS"That's the thing. People will get a tattoo and literally be a walking lifetime advertisement for nitrogen sports. That's a pretty big thing for just a thousand bucks as a one time payment. Even if the person doesn't get a tattoo right off the bat, he/she can easily tell his/her friends who may want to get a tattoo anyway. That word of mouth spreads, and instantly the name NitrogenSports gets knocked around multiple times.It's all a pretty strong marketing strategy. Even though there are benefits for the people who get involved, don't fool yourself; nitrogen sports is definitely trying to make their money's worth through tattoos as advertisement."
p16
aS"It's crazy!I mean, you are getting paid about 1000$ to get stucked with a tatoo permamently, and this tatoo of nitrogensports can't be explained.Anyway, that's a funny contest and I believe that the challange is going to be accepted by people from 3rd world countries, that this 1000$ can totally change their life.By the way, I think that people are going to make a temporaly tatoo and to claim that it is a permament one."
p17
aS"Sounds crazy but this one is perfect advertisement for nitrogen sports since tattoos will last forever on a persons skin and might they will get some attention with it, But It's so pity for the guy who will do it since he will get only few $ for lifetime ad posting on his body. But lets see if there are more sick guys will do this one since I think many people will grab that in the name of immediate money."
p18
aS"They aren't first that came up with this idea. First time I heard for that was years ago, I found some article from 10 years ago http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3477293/Brothel-offers-free-entry-to-men-who-have-its-name-tattooed-on-their-arm.html. Looks like there are some things you can get only if you make logo of some company, I has a nice laugh watching what people do for little money. Nitrogen asked for a little tattoo, you can hide that quarter somewhere, and if you like nitrogen that is like some nice support. 1000 dollars can be used nice, good move in my opinion. "
p19
aS"Haha that's actually funny. It's not surprising that this promo is over because it's quite easy and cheap to make small tattoo as these ones, and if 0.1 is worth 1000$ right now, it might be worth 10000$ in few months... Really great offer though."
p20
aS'It was fun for those who like tattoo art, but for some people who do not like it then it was not fun at all. I have to admit they did a crazy promo, but I do not think it is a good way of advertising because the tattoo is not visible anywhere anytime. I have a friend who like this art, too bad I missed this promo. If I did not miss it, perhaps I could ask my friend to make a nitrogen tattoo on part of his body then we can split the prize LOL. '
p21
aS"Well at the end of the day people are responsible for what happens to their bodies, I appreciate tattoos but I will never put one in my body, especially when you are young, I'm sure there are many people that look at their bodies and think, what was I thinking? So if there were people that got a nitrogen sports tattoo after the winners were selected I suppose they will be thinking that for the rest of their lives."

aS'For the newbie asking him to start gambling is like committing the suicide. never do this mistake. As far as concerned about earning btc you can do it in multiple ways like doing the small tasks, joining the bounty campaign, also FB/Twitter campaigns.

aS'There are campaigns here that pays you bitcoin if you do some task for them like bounty and signature campaign with no risk but pays high, also there is gambling with high risk not recommend for newbies i dont not recommend this at all because gambling is only for rich people. You can also trading with minimum risk just dont buy shitcoins and coins that are already pumped.'

But with these ways you need to invest at the beginning and with a small capital at the start you will only can earn small amount everyday.

But, those are pretty hard to find and you are like gambling to find those. "

aS'Hi, if you lack the experience necessary to invest in Bitcoin then you should just buy Bitcoin and hold onto it while you learn and become more proficient. You should study the intricate details of this particular asset class and then study how Etherium works. Read articles online at Coindesk, go on youtube and visit reputable channels like "Data Dash" to get a good idea on which coins are going up in value, which wont do so well and which will may or may not go up in value in the next year.You could learn how to read a white paper, and you could teach your self about economics. There are a plethora of people in the Crypto space who know nothing about economics and keep saying words like "bubble" and "dump" which is a misleading term to this form Austrian Economics.Those terms pertain to the market fluctuations of Inflationary and centrally planned Keynesian Economics currency, not Bitcoin which is limited in supply and fluctuates to market demand through trade and the production of good and services.\xc2\xa0 '

See games and rounds where you can still earn some bitcoins while promoting done ICOs/alts socially.Risks are there in everything whether you put in your money or not, that if a company goes scamming and decide not to pay their users for their work (or don't send coins in escrow address), manager goes helpless and needs to end the campaign without paying anyone, that's where your investment of time gets you nothing."

You could first try to join signature campaigns but you have to make your rank high so you could qualify to join. And you can start to join them and get to earn with them. You could try to buy at low and sell at high prices. Or maybe try trading but this is too much risky. '
p24
aS'I think that the bitcoin has to suffer a massive price decline to the areas of 6000-5000$ before it can continue with the up trend.A lot of foolish money has entered the crypto world, and has to leave before we can enter a new wave of price increases.Also at the last weeks bitcoin has been increasing from about 4000$ to 9000$ really fast, and failed to break the 10K resistance and stay above 10K$.I believe that after the massive price fix, if we will be able to stay above the 10K$ level for long then we will be able to go even further to the levels of 12-13 K.'

aS"Well joining in signature campaign can increase your bitcoin but while you are just a newbie you can't join yet. But once you rank up and you can post quality idea, you can earn from it.

The way to go about this is to take advantage of the skills you already have. Monetise your skills and monetize with Bitcoin. In the real world, people don't pick money on the streets. That's how it is in the cyberculture of cryptocurrencies.What skills do you have? What services can you render for bitcoin? You can start in this forum by advertising such services. Ask people to pay you in Bitcoin and you'll watch your bitcoin stock stack up. For instance, I am a writer so people pay me with Bitcoin to write.I even saw a post in which someone asked to be paid in Bitcoin for supplying fresh meat. Do render a service or sell a product. Later, as your rank increases, you would be able to join in signature campaigns and earn more bitcoins. "

aS'Good suggestion! Never ever get involve on gambling if you dont like to lose up money since you are just starting up for sure you are really targeting on accumulating bitcoin or profits. Trading is a wise choice but wont really be an easy thing to learn on since you would really need skills and patience for it to be effective.You might able to start up on small amounts on sort of practicing dont tend to go on big capital directly for sure you would really lose those amounts.Anything on this bitcoin world do have risk the thing here is that we should able to handle it.'
p41
aS'Keep in mind that looking to maxinize your bitcoins by persuing gambling does not make any sense even for experienced players.Gambling can make you win only if you have good luck but there are high chances you may lose all of your money in a single bet.To grow your bitcoins by a method to be devoid of risk, i would suggest to make investment in bitcoin right now'
p42
aS'First I\xc2\x92m suggesting Trading. I started with trading on Cryptocurrencies as a newbie, but let me warn you, I was already a pro trader on Forex trading before getting into Bitcoin for Crypto trading. So if you want to go for this, you better make out some time and learn it properly cause if you\xc2\x92re not good, you\xc2\x92ll be losing money. After that, next stuff I tried out was freelancing. Maybe you should try out offering skilled\xc2\x96services and getting paid in bitcoin\xc2\x96 that\xc2\x92s what I\xc2\x92m doing now, and it\xc2\x92s really paying off. I don\xc2\x92t know for other ones, but if you think of faucet, that one is trash. Faucets used to be a very good place to help the newbies understand more about bitcoin, but now it\xc2\x92s quite a trash.'
p43
aS"By engaging yourself in bitcoin industry you have to be backed up by knowledge before starting to invest, trade or to make any move. Well you can have it by asking and researching. Every investments have its own risks as well as btc. You can acquire btc by joining signature campaign, offering service with btc as paymnet. Those are some of the ways but you will jot earn big there. If you want high income try investing (but it's for long term) with the good standing of btc in the market for sure it will pump and you will get high return of investment."
p44
aS'trade has become one of the alternatives to earn additional income in our own way, but there are times when activities will we do for trade must have a strategy and patience to get started. do not be too keen on getting bigger profits if we still do not understand the basics, starting from small quantities first so we can understand the techniques in trading coins that we will trade.'
p45
aS'That is indeed true, but the fact is it is not just all about profits. Sometimes traders lose on their trades, that is something every newbie to trading should know. It is not all happy days. Sometimes, you have to take losses and that is part of trading. Getting profits, will take time and practice so any new trader should never expect they will do it right the first time they do it.'
p46
aS'I would suggest you earn bitcoins and hold them up to get good turn over. There is no risk involved in, only your skills and hardwork require. We have campaigns paying good amount for your contribution. Go through sections meant for beginners. You will master yourself. All the best. '
p47
aS'either invest in bitcoin while it so high or invest in some altcoins because i think the price of bitcoin is still growing so do it now then wait for profit and if bitcoin price is so high some altcoins will drop the price so buy that low price altcoins then sell it in high price,Moreover try to put some money also in gambling to experience and to play some poker site here in bitcoin and read some ideas in gambling section'
p48
aS"There are so many ways to growth your amount of Bitcoin like trading, gambling, holding, investing in ICO project or just joining campaign in this forum. But I think the best way to growth your Bitcoin amount is trading and investing in ICO, these ways are the fastest ways to earn more Bitcoin, gambling is also a fast way but it's too risky so I think you shouldn't try this way. Beside you can join any campaign in this forum to earn free amount of Bitcoin everyweek, the amount of Bitcoin you'll get everyweek is small or big depend on your forum account rank and your post quality."
p49
aS'If you have enough capital, you can sell and buy bitcoin to grow the amount of bitcoin larger than before. Because the risk of trading is not too large when compared with an investment that is not yet clear whether it can be profitable or otherwise.'
p50
aS'Lol,. it is funny how some users of this forum tend to mix up gambling with investment or a way of trying to increase money. This is something that has to do with luck and the last time I checked, it is not something that one is guaranteed a win all the time.In fact, the chances of losing are even higher. There are so many options to make money for someone who is smart and not lazy and some of the things you have mentioned are just some pretty ways to go and so much more like offering possible services or using some of the freelance platforms.'
p51
aS'That is also very effective because Bitcoin price changes will happen within the second it is not possible for us to ride the Boat when trading with the Bitcoin. So the only best option buys them at the low price when the price is dipping and start holding for Higher price returns.'
p52
aS"Invest. Don't mine if you don't know what you're really doing or if you're having problems dealing with your monthly electricity bills. Buying Bitcoins then holding it for a long-term investment will help you earn early profit if you do it as a starter. To grow in Bitcoin is to circle around the forums and learn the nature of Bitcoin. Joining campaigns will help you a lot in earning here. Invest now while you still can because the rise of the price of BTC is continuous and it might reach the amount that isn't expected or forecast. "
p53
aS'If you want to grow your bitcoins then lending is one of the best and risk free you can lend your bitcoin to someone who are in immediate need for bitcoin or fiat then collect your bitcoins back with some rate of interest.Or you can invest on miners which will gives you good profit but noways bitcoin mining becomes very tough so you can do altcoin mining then convert them into bitcoins.'
p54
aS"maybe gambling is one of the best ways to help you produce bitcoin quickly,you can gamble with no risksuch as following poker freeroll turnament,and also follow the scoring guess event and many more,and that's all you can get while increasing your knowledge and experience"
p55
aS'I would not consider this for someone who does not have good knowledge about trading. It is easy to say buy and sell, but hit the charts and see that the trading world is not an easy ground to thread on without some good skills and strategies. It can be profitable for sure, but you have to understand that if you are not skillful, then you are just gambling, not trading.'
p56
aS"Gambling however, is not the best road to go when you are trying to increase your funds, as you will get the worst experience at the end.Lending services can actually be fun if you have those you are targeting though. You can lose a lot if you are not careful. So many people do lending services on this forum and deal with users they can trust anyway or with high level of trust, but that does not guarantee anything, so like I said; you still have to be smart.ICOs are really a very good way but it requires being careful as well. However, there is nothing that is easy and in the world of investment and most especially in the crypto world, being careful should always be the first watchword. However, trying to research well on the team and the viability of a project is always a good way to start, otherwise, it would be so easy losing one's fund real bad in ICOs."
p57
aS"For now I think trading without trading skills and knowledge is possible cause for now there are a lot of trading signal group or trading bot like Gunbot. Trader can pay a small amount to join group or buy bot to start trading. It's very easy to use and I think it's really work. Take a look at Gunbot trading bot, a lot of member in this forum are using it for trading and I think they can earn a lot of Bitcoin everyday because of it."
p58
aS'This is one of the option where bot helps you trade and make the decision on your behalf. Secondly it will be better if one them self understand and gain knowledge so that they can invest in such cypto currency and predict the future of the market. This will help in investing in the right coin for the long term perspective.'
p59
aS'Trading is really good for someone who can settle down to learn. I have seen a lot of people rush into trading in the past thinking it is some sort of a way to make some quick bucks. One thing about trading is that, if you do not have the knowledge or a strategy, then it should be considered a gamble.For someone who is not lazy, they can make a lot in the freelance world like you said and at the end of it all, be happy with what they have been able to save up for themselves.'
p60
aS'If you are ready to face to lose and profit both means you can consider with the bitcoin earning option. If the price changes move forward to low also you have to accept the dip and lose you find in the opened trade. In trading you have to open a trade with the high value you find in that time, if value crosses more in the chart after sometime you can sell it out for profit. Mostly people sell when the price bumps and buy when the price dips in the chart.'
p61
aS'Signature campaign is pretty good and gets anyone to earn pretty much to save up in the long run without much stress since we are learning and contributing anyway. Even though some people have abused it a lot, but it is good to always set oneself apart to be able to get into some good campaigns in the long run.Bounty campaigns are good too but it takes a lot of work trying to scan through the project, so one does not end up doing some free jobs for some scammers.'
p62
aS"Trading is a good source of income, actually most of the people taking the risk of that job, because they expecting good profit when bitcoin value is growing up. Like what you said they buy a lot of stocks when their price are going deep and they can sell it when price are raising up.However not all the time bitcoin was increasing price, so there's a tendency that we hold it for several moments. To the owners of this thread I suggest to buy bitcoin now and hold it for long period of time because I assure you that when time come past bitcoin value will become more expensive."
p63
aS'We are all aware of sudden increasing trend value of Bitcoins this past few days. Alongside of this, we should think twice on how we react with this changes. It is good to say if were going to invest at this early point of time, we could earn more in future days, I have no enough ideas about other ways like gambling, but as far as I know, this is your taking risk, which is just in one snap, you could double but unluckily you would lose all. In my side, it is a hard feeling for me to take risk all, that depends upon my luck. '
p64
aS'Trading and gambling would be best to grow your bitcoin but please be aware that this two has huge risks and it would be better to be wise to gamble and trade. But I think it would be good if you just hold your preferred coins to invest just like Bitcoin or Ethereum because it is the safest way you can grow your money. But if you want to acquire more bitcoin, then, buy a mining rig so that you can have more of it.'
p65
aS"Gambling at the beginning stage? That's a right way to lose everything you have. Don't do that and try to avoid those suggestions.Before you go with growing your funds. Learn more about risks involving on the same before digging into it.Trading could be good comparing with gambling since you can save something and its about act according to the market trend. Try to invest small amount and start. Huge investment is not at all good at the initial level.Also you can do mining to earn. Just dive into that section and read the pinned topics for basics and post your questions from that."
p66
aS" Lots of benefits can be shared. Just earn bitcoin and experience them. No risk is involved. You contribute your skills and time supporting the forum, you will gain a lot. Bitcoin's growth is mesmerizing and stunning. In last two days, it had a spike of $2K. Now its at $17.5K. So, as long as you are working and earning some bitcoins, you will benefit yourself. Welcome onboard. All the best"
p67
aS'Since you are willing to risk, i would suggest you to do trading to make some profits in bitcoin. Though you should learn about trade before you involve yourself into it. You should learn how the market works and how to trade efficiently. You can also try lending bitcoins to people and earn from interests.'
p68
aS"My advice would be to not invest in bitcoin right now. Sure it can go to 20k but that wouldn't be much of a profit. Personally I think ethereum is absolutely undervalued and could easily go to 1k+ soon enough, which would be around 2.5x. Other alt coins have even bigger potential, bitcoin will not bring you that much of a profit and is also volatile as hell specially right now, it's a goddamn bomb. Ethereum is much more stable."
p69
aS'Well there are ways here in Bitcointalk on how to grow your Bitcoins.\xc2\xa0 Good thing in this forum is that, this is a complete package, you can learn, earn and transact business with other member here.\xc2\xa0 You should know how to learn then and research since these are the basic of making your bitcoin growth venture successful.\xc2\xa0 Be patient and be updated.'
p70

You can mine your bitcoin.3. Invest ot trade bitcoin.4. Play games / do gambling using bitcoin. But its risky because a gamble is a gamble and you might lost everything from it.'
p71
aS'There are so many ways to earn bitcoins.\xc2\xa0 The most common are1. Signature campaign.\xc2\xa0 This is a risk-free way of earning bitcoins.\xc2\xa0 You only have to join a signature campaign and make a certain number of constructive posts based of a set of rules.2.

p72
aS'here already covers the whole about bitcoin. many of the definite discussions you will find when you are about to ask questions. starting a business will be very easy if it starts from here. and no need to worry because there will be no stupidity here'
p73
aS'I would not be so sure about that. So many people have heeded to advices like this when bitcoin was way lower and they missed the chance to at least get when the value was low thinking that is a peak. No one knows how high bitcoin would keep going, and it is better to get in at any stage rather than having this mentality of do not buy now because the price is too high. If I may ask, what happens if the price keeps going further? It has happened several times before.'
p74
aS' I would now suggest you to buy or earn more bitcoins from the sources available in bitcointalk forum. Bitcoin value is flying to the moon reaching $15K plus. I have not come across any risk involved in earning bitcoins. You contribute your skills, time and earn. But we have few risk factors in holding the bitcoins as such "hacking". Keep your wallet so secured. Advantages would be, earn and solve all your economy problems. '
p75
aS"If you have some money ready for investing to begin trading then its one of the straight way to grow your coins. Before that learn about the market trend from the beginning to the present and mostly about the various events happened in between. Those are just to get some idea because fresh minds will help to think smart sometime.Also if you are a talented guy in any technical stuff related to software. You will get more opportunities on earnings. Anything like programmer etcDo not start with gamble instead let it be with your wallet that will grow your fiat's There many real life histories who lost so many in gambling so its applicable to crypto as well"
p76
aS'"BEST" is a very questionable term.It depends what are you looking for, would you mind to risk your money?If you are willing to risk your money I would suggest you to learn trading and then try to earn funds through trading, but please notice that it may cause to your whole balance to be deleted as trading is a very risky activity.If you are not willing to risk your bitcoins through the process I would suggest you to work for bitcoins, or just do the easiest way, work for fiat and convert the part of the fiat that you are willing to invest into bitcoins at every month.'
p77
aS'The best way to growth bitcoin that is investment...But it has a lot of riskYou should study more before making any decisions...'
p78
aS'Value or numbers of bitcoin?. Because holding bitcoin will not result In adding bitcoin numbers but only to its value. As I only know a site of bitcoin faucet having that option of daily or monthly interest for just holding an amount minimum. So that it is the only thing I have seen so far or maybe I need to look for others.'
p79
aS'This may a bit be broad but if you dont have money, you can join campaigns such us signature and social media. There are these ICO and Tokens but i think you would know them once you get a hold of bitcoin. Because they follow the same scheme but not all of them are successful. And sometimes you have to have more experience in trading to adapt it more. Meaning you have to at least sacrifice some small amount to learn it for yourself.'
p80
aS"If you have a lot of bitcoin then do hold some of it because for me it's non stop to continue to grow and atleast you try to risk some than nothing to do,you can either lose your investment or have profit in your investment but chance for profit is really high base on the nonstop grow of bitcoin.We can say it risky but i think for me you only need to wait to have high price then sell it in that situation,Moreover try to gambling some of your bitcoin also if you have really a lot like in poker but you only have luck to earn or it base only in luck to earn bitcoin"
p81
aS'This is a very good one and unfortunately some newbies have fallen for this mistake thinking gambling is a very good way for them to double what they have which is totally wrong. Rather than trying to gamble, it is just best to keep working hard to save up no matter how little as they will end up growing anyway in value rather than trying luck that is even so tired of helping people out when even the luck itself cannot beat the house edge to it unless you are just super lucky.'
p82
aS'Investing in bitcoin alone itself is a risk, so for anyone who would want to consider something else to keep their coins growing, they have to make sure it is worth it so it ends up worth it. Like you said, it is necessary for everyone to think twice before acting in anyway because a little mistake can make them lose their funds more than they can expect.For example, gambling is just one way that people have lost their money and I really why people have always imagined it to be a good move to increase their funds.'
p83
aS'Just explore first the community read from the posts and threads, or participate into discussions raise questions. Then gradually you will learn faucets, signature and bounty campaigns (you need to be atleast Jr. Member to participate.), or if you have skills in blogging and translations then its better because you can get big rewards for that service. If you have the capital to buy Bitcoin or other altcoins, then that would be better for it will make you gain profit faster than just offering your service like what I have mentioned above. But this bears a lot of risk because it needs enough knowledge to have a succesful investment dont worry this community will be your stepping stone. Just asks questions about the specific subject that interests you the most.'
p84
aS'Skills, hard work with some level of smartness in doing the right thing to make some good bucks is all that is needed in this world. So many people always miss that and then they keep looking for shortcuts everywhere until they end up finding out the hard way that there is just no shortcut to success in life.You have to work for it and earn it. Learning is important at every stage and without that; opportunities may be missed for those who are not well informed.'
p85

Like you have said, that is one silly mistake a lot of people have made and are still making.Rather than looking for better things to do, they think luck will be the thing they rely on to make some bucks for themselves, when the owners of the gambling sites are not even there to come and do charity in the first place.'
p98
aS"there are a lot of techniques to earn bitcoin like trading, campaign and mining.in campaign most rewards given are in a form of alts which you can trade later after they list it on exchange, this is good because it doesn't need investment.trading needs money because you will have to buy alts and wait for it to pump and then trade it for bitcoins, it's just simply buy low and sell high, but this one is not an easy job because it takes a lot of skill to earn from this.mining, I don't know much about these but I think if you don't know how to setup a mining rig stay out of it or else you will just waste your money but if you have a good friend or someone that knows mining very well that's fine."

If you trrat bitcoin as an asset, do trading, since a lot of high volatile assets like gold are being traded in the market daily, and mostly what is happenig is accumulation and selling, that means you need to do cost average as well, however,if you treat bitcoin like currency, look on ways on how you can be paid using bitcoin, joining signature campaigns is a good start, but do.not jus stop on the campaigns, since you are going to treat bitcoin as currency, might as well ask bitcoin for your services.'

aS'you are absolutely right, that the community of the crypto currency has become much larger and because of this the whole network is overloaded, but I see in it only a positive moment, because the crypto currency has spread faster in the society, What it was just a year ago. Perhaps it was a huge jump in the price of Bitcoin that served as a large-scale popularization of the crypto currency in the world.'
p133
aS'I started with faucets and I thought that I can make millions with that, irony is that I really could I should just keep all earnings and to not spent nothing and all that satoshis would worth a lot now, faucets before are nothing like faucets today.Trading is very popular, people wish to make money from home computer and trading with bitcoins and alts can be very profitable.

Maybe he can try to join bounty programs, airdrops? Nah. Airdrops seems to be running on scam lately.

Most members said that you should go trading, then learn all about trading. Learn the risk involves and advantages. Everything. No one will coach you here because all of us started our trading from scratch. We earn it the hard way."

Study thier projects and other stuffs to make sure you are investing in the correct ICO and coins. Split your investment. This would be the correct time to buy more altcoins i would say.

That's why more of the users withdraw their amount in crypto currencies because they expecting that this month it was going so so deep.

p161
aS'Waiting to have better is not a big deal. Wait today and one day you will get big reward for it. I am in favor of holding bitcoin. Today bitcoin price is really affordable it is chance for people to buy bitcoin and invest it for long time. Bitcoin can be use even without investing anything so join signature campaign and make money from it; bitcoin can be use as side source of income like having your job you can earn, using your spare time. It is good to hold for long time never take action against low rating of bitcoin just keep patience and hold bitcoin.'
p162
aS"My suggestion is avoid Bitcoin and grown your crypto in other coins. Bitcoin is slow, outdated, and is starting to lose its grip. Plus with the pending Tether scandal, it could lose up to 80% if the allegations are confirmed. I know there will be Bitcoin diehards telling you it will never happen, but hey, you are here to make money, and your money needs to be in the best place, and in that respect, the Bitcoin train has left the station and nobody else can get on. My friend invested 10,000 when it was 20,000. He got half a Bitcoin, and now he has a 25% of a Bitcoin since its plunge. Now if he would of made a wise money choice instead of a hype choice, he could of invested in Monero, Ripple, IOTA, something that was more stable and he would of made profits, had thousands of shares, and would not have lost half his money. Diversify, buy low, and research/monitor your investments for maximum profit. Now if you are a Bitcoin zealot, buy away, but don't be mad when the plunge goes deeper and please don't preach to me, because Bitcoin is slow and I ain't got time to deal with it, unless I need to use it to buy another coin on an exchange. But hey, at least I can eat a pizza and play a few rounds of Battlegrounds before it deposits into my exchange."

Under the new rules of the Forum, you need to rank Member can join. Good luck.'

p169
aS"Many people think that Bitcoin will continue to grow strongly in 2018. Many believe that Bitcoin will cost $ 50,000. They prove by analyzing the market and their way of thinking. However, this value is too lacking when the price of the common market is still relatively low. Bitcoin has not released anything yet in 2018. Bitcoin's technology is still the same, and other coin changes. In my opinion, the price of Bitcoin will increase, it may increase to $ 30,000 but it means that other coin will also grow like that."
p170
aS'bitcoin growth will continue this year but maybe there is a little fluctuation that occurs but after it will return to normal, for you who are new and have not had experience I suggest do not trade with a large amount of capital, because it will cause a big risk because you can lose all your bitcoin in the trade, you better do something like look for a job to get some bitcoin, like being a translator or following an existing campaign, but if you want to trade you should do with a small capital and look for as much experience in trading ,'

p175
aS'Gambling is OK if you want to get some fun but as a money making method is not a good option, but many think that just because you can in theory multiply your money many times over in a game that is going to happen to them but that is not true, in a way trading has a similar appeal with the difference that trading is not supposed to be fun, earning bitcoin is no different than to earn fiat, so whatever you are doing to earn fiat is something you can do to earn bitcoin.'
p176
aS'I think you\xe2\x80\x99d better spend time studying a lot in this market ,you must know basic knowledge of bitcoin which is really necessary for you, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand clearly the process of bitcoin, you definitely get profits from btc. Keep an eye on it regularly to get updating news and analyze it carefully. You can have your friends, relatives share you experience, which helps you a lot.

p5
aS"I just don't think there is the demand for this type of site yet to become a success.bitmit.net was a good site.. very similar to ebay, just one problem, very few products available for sale. not only that, very little traffic for sellers so they aren't encouraged to list more items. \xc2\xa0same thing with the likes of cryptothrift.com. \xc2\xa0It's almost a catch-22, like i said too early for bitcoin only auction websites. \xc2\xa0Give it a year or two, but by this time i would expect ebay to accept bitcoin (perhaps through paypal, who knows)"
p6
aS"But give these things time. They'll grow organically. There's a nice little ammount of stuff on Crytothroft and the listings grow daily. I'd rather use that and sell my stuff directly for coin rather than sell it on ebay and get scammed on fees. "

p2
aS'You cannot find investments with high return and have less risk. Those investments with low returns are the safe once. Simply put, those investments that offer higher returns are those Ponzi sites or the scam sites. They are offering those kind of things in order to attract more investors then run. On the other hand, legit investments offer low return because they are computing the right dividend to spread to its investors exactly based on your invested capital.I suggest you invest your money in trading, this involve high risk, but depends on your skills and knowledge about the coin you are trading. But later on, will surely give you profit as you master the right timing on where to buy or sell.'

p8
aS'0.1 BTC is very small for a low risk investment. You will be wasting your time if you do. The best thing for you to do is to gamble it in a high risk investment like altcoins since that amount is easily replaceable. What is the point to invest and dont see profit thats worth it? Not even 100 years will give you enough money to live by with 0.1 BTC. '
p9
aS'A post above mentioned gambling casinos and crypto-games. Which gambling casinos/crypto-games websites are popular with members here? Looking for the best ones.Is gambling casinos/crypto-games safe and what % return do i expect there?Or is there any websites out there that offer a higher % return than Poloniex but safe like Poloniex?

p13
aS"Lending on Poloniex is much better than throw your money into random sites, even it gives you small return that's even better than get nothing/loss.Every investment has their own risk, but we can minimize that risk with learn properly."
p14
aS"This kind of desires is commonly present to the lazy ones. You managed to have some around BTC0.1 then how you obtained it? If your method works then just continue to do it. There's no such thing as investment with an instant good returns with lower risk.Work to earned instead and forget those keeping the money thing in an online site and expect some passive income. "
p15
aS"With a 0.1 BTC investment on casino bankroll you can earn few dollars interest after one month or so... It's not too much, but you must think a little investment of about $120 doesn't bring high returns on real life and it's not different on the internet. But it's the best way in my opinion to earn passive income, as the rates are much higher than saving accounts."
p16
aS'you can invest in fiat. '
p17
aS'Trade it and start learning other things to earn bitcoin rather than to idle coins and expect for a good returns.(Low Risk=Low Returns ; High Risk=High Returns)How to make this (Low Risk=High returns)? Forget that. What you will do is to minimize the high risk so that it can give you the high returns you want.

p23
aS"In reality no one place are riskless to make profit and better return without risk .By chance you can get return in Ponzi sites but can't get Everytime return .I will suggest you to start trading also with your bitcoin Because trading is also like the lending in the Poloniex , if you will understand and will do trading wisely then surely you will get earning without\xc2\xa0 risk , Because without trading ( day trading + altcoins trading) you can't go for big earning ."
p24
aS"0 1 btc is a good amount to start but keep in mind that if you want to earn you should take risk. Trading is the best way for me but like other said it's very risky but if you think you can take the risk.then go for it"

aS'Yeah its worth to take risk in trading and that risk can be reduced if you learn the entire process of trading and then enter into it and even if you make loss at initial stage you should not worry as it will give you good learning experience.'
p26
aS"That is not so rare, i have seen my funds many times on negative profit after investing into cryptocurrency casino, but you are right about the first part- it mostly was on short term.Poloniex has pretty decent return of lending rates, you can make up a good profit with enough funds, but you shouldn't compare it to investing into casino bankroll.Lending business is something where you can be sure that the profit is going to be made, and with investing into bankroll of gambling website you cannot know, if it will bring profits from you, or the site will lose ( and you too).The second option is mostly about how many players are in there, because if you can see many players doing bets, then you will probably get a really nice gains on long term."

p31
aS'Ok then in what altcoin would you recommend that he invest his 0.1 BTC in? Why do you think its good and tell us if you invested in it yourself.We also want to know what altcoins you were trading that have given you profit and what have given you losses.'

aS"Yeah an I just want to emphasize, if you want a low risk investment. Then trading isn't for you. We all know that trading involve high risk because there are lots of things you should consider before engaging in trading. It will give you a decent profit or even huge if you made the right decision. BUT, the counterpart might occur if you made the wrong decision. Trading requires such skill in decision making, having a research and staying away from those scam coins scattered from different trading platforms."

p38
aS'Tell me how 0.1 BTC is big. In any country I can say that from an investment standpoint at the current rates 0.1 BTC is not big enough to be called a REAL investment. Maybe if youre a 14 year old, you can. How old are you by the way?'

p42
aS'Do you understand about invest in Casino? . He said to invest in casino not "play" on it .If you are aware with risk in gambling the other ways is to invest your money to bankroll and see your money growing.

p43
aS'If you start to invest your bitcoin into investment sites, than it is too risky. I will suggest you, better is that avoid it to invest online investments sites. Because my experience is very bad about investment sites. '
p44
aS"I do believe as per current situations, there is no legit opportunities for our bitcoins except few gambling sites' bankroll based profit sharing programs. Once bitcoin will be having price levels like $2000, we may once again get cloud mining opportunities but not sure as mining difficulties too increase.Like old saying, bitcoin itself an investment and honestly I am comfortable with it as getting scammed due to greedy is completely eliminated by this."
p45
aS'I think that with such an opportunity as bitcoin gives, we could get really good returns as far as 5 years will pass.Buying 0.1 btc every month might really stack up in you favour, only try to imagine that.1 year is 12 months, so it means that you buy 1.2btc every year.Stack up bitcoins every month through 5 years, and you w ill have 1.2 x 5 equation which is 6btc in total saving of 5 years.How much bitcoin might be worth in 2022? We might even see 4000$ price possible, lets say it will be fulfilled, so it gives us 4000$ x 6 = 24000$ in 5 years- by saving only about 120$ monthly ( on current price )'

aS'If you still wonder where to invest, I am offering 20% on every investment trusted for a period of 1 weekI am buying gift cards for amazon at low rate and sell stuffs to people from my town. For the process they pay me 30% in advance and the rest 70% when I give them the itemI am also giving loans to people from my town, but I do it only if they agree to pay me an interest of 50% or more on a short period'
p47
aS'If you can save 0.1 BTC every month for 5 years then yes, it could be a worthwhile investment. But the OP didnt mention anything about adding 0.1 BTC every month. He said just the 0.1 BTC he has now.'
p48
aS"There's no such way of earning the best return without taking the highest risk. If you want to take the best returns then you should be ready on taking the highest risk. But if you are relaxed on taking up the lowest risk then don't expect that it will give you the best and highest profit. As of now, I can only think about trading."
p49
aS'If I was him I would much rather buy something that I like with it than thinking of investing. No one becomes rich from a small investment unless he wins the lottery. Why not enjoy the 0.1 BTC and buy something nice with it.'
p50
aS'U can do a short-term investment with HYIP. invest maybe in one week etc, depends on your feel to the HYIP website will close in how many days.Remember try to withdraw daily if can as compound interest might let u become greedy.If u not sure, check HYIP monitor but check the famous one.U can do bitcoin and altcoin trading.Bitcoin one part and altcoin one part.Try to avoid exchange like yobit if u are newbie because there are many dead coin no updated.Bitcoin u can gain the difference more directly, altcoin u need to be careful because some coin will suddenly become zero.Stay some bitcoin , doge for future. Doge for transaction and move fund.Like some ppl says u can invest in bankroll. But be4 u invest, u need to check others profit or not in that website as many gambling website now. U need to create portfolio if u invest many gambling site bankroll. If u invest , better no play. If u can handle when u loss, then np.Some project when starting they will need some funding. U can invest if u feel good to them.Also applied to ICO. but u need more experience for that. u need to research.Not many ICO are success. many down due to no ppl play on it.'
p51
aS'Trading is a good place to invest your bitcoins and also I feel that investing in reputed casino bankrolls can also give you good returns in long run but its risky to invest in those sites as some of them may turn scam in long run and will make you loose all your money.'
p52
aS'To get good profits from casinos you also need to have good amount of capital then only you will feel some profits but with higher capital there is always an high risk of loosing it so invest only that amount that you can afford to loose either in casinos or in trading.'
p53
aS'Maybe, you can invest to casino or any businesses under Bitcoin.'
p54
aS"He only got under 0.1 BTC and that isn't going to be enough to get a good return if he is going to invest in casino's. It's better if he is going to try to invest in trading or some other types of ICO's that are very promising. Others are going to suggest go with HYIP for short term but I don't consider that to be helpful that will suck up your btc."
p55
aS'Actual even you just place your bitcoin in your wallet it grows automatically as the price of bitcoin going to the moon. But if you are in a hurry, just invest it to rising altcoins.'
p56
aS'I will invest my bitcoins i think Lending the bitcoins this method is little in risk than to the other and this is more potential for fraud. And the other one is landing because it will double your money and a good profit, Lending is shot time only to make money quick. But the safest way to is to hold if for the years to come, and wait for the price and its a long time investment.'
p57
aS'You can search for different investments sites on google with less risk but the problem is it will take\xc2\xa0 months or year to get your roi back. But if you choose the high risk , 1 month you get your roi back or before you get your roi the site will turned into scam.'
p58
aS'if you invest low price returns low price if you invest high price also return high price that is a investing\xc2\xa0 for me its good to invest in casino but need high risk profit but not sure if you are lucky win .'
p59
aS"Find some ico which you beleive it can grow and get success in the future. There's a lot new ico born every week in this forum, you can choose one, do your own analyze, and remember not all of these ico will success, most of them going failed or scam.Or if you can't find it, you can invest on bitcoin it self. I mean, trade your bitcoin. Sell when it high, and buy more when it low. Trust me, it works."
p60
aS"Imo gambling sites have a higher return % than poloniex. I tried investing on a casino's bankroll before and after 3 months the returns I got was ~15%. It's hard to say if you're going to get the same return or might be even more because not every investor invested at the same time."
p61
aS'first if you have already have good btc amount want to grow it then best way is to start investing in trust able upcoming project.second if you have low btc amount then it is good to do altcoin trading,it takes a lot time but you will earn good if applied in right manner.'
p62
aS'I am not aware of altvoon trading. I have heard the bitcoin trading seems good and you could earn continuously using trading and there lot of people coming to sell out their bitcoins for the daily needs. So we can many\xc2\xa0 trades everyday when compare to altcoin trading.'

aS'You allready did the investment! You bought Bitcoin. W8 5 years and see where it goes '
p64
aS"Hmmm 0.1 BTC? for a low risk investment does not seem to exist, it would be a waste of your time if you do. The best thing to do is to gamble on high-risk investments such as altcoins because the number is easily replaceable. so it's time to gamble lol\xc2\xa0 "
p65
aS'I do agree to some of the comments and posts on this thread, the best way to invest your 0.1BTC is either through trading altcoins but it does take some time so you really need to have lots of patience for you to earn a certain amount. Then the other way to invest is through gambling; though it is the easiest way to increase your profit, it is also the riskiest way and so it might be the easiest way to lose your money too. '
p66
aS"To invest in trade of altcoins you don't need only patience, but luck and some skills also to know which altcoin to choose, the one is more profitable and the one won't die very fast... Most of the altcoins are worthless coins that can lose price any moment, the pumps are fake and their real price is 0 or 1 satoshi... It's complicated."
p67
aS'I invest my bitcoins in my mattress.'
p68
aS'Lots of places that can be used to invest bitcoin. We can play trading and save capital at home casino. But there is one place that I think is inappropriate to use, that is HYIP. Do not ever try to play HYIP because you can easily lose the bitcoin you have. HYIP has an erratic system so your chances of losing bitcoin are 50%.'
p69
aS"It is nearly impossible to find place to invest that have tiny risk and nice profit, unless it is scam site. So you either have to invest in sites that aren't risky but profit is very small, or don't inveat your bitcoins anywhere, just keep them in your wallet till their price rises. If i were you, i would avoid investing in any gambling site, as they are usually scam sites."
p70
aS'Finally someone who is saying the truth, altcoin trading is a very hard way to generate profits, even when trader is having required skills and knowledge.It is a very risky activity, because even these coins with great potential are in the pump&dump game, they are sometimes used as a tool for big players to get great returns with just pumping the particular alts with the bitcoins they own.I still think that actually, forex trading is easier than altcoin trading, but everybody makes his own choices.'
p71
aS'Sometime ago i were follow the bankroll investments of a member here, and well the results were amazing he invested 5 bitcoins with 3 casinos, and he had made 1 btc into something like 2-4 months. At poloniex trading is very hot, soo you can make money as well loose trying, lending could return 1-1,5% soo considering potencial earnings and low risk bankroll sounds a pretty nice investment.'
p72
aS'i thinking the same like you, because he got his bitcoin by poloniex but i wonder how he can payback the bitcoin for now? and is it true that until now he still keep that amount in his wallet? because as far as i know, if we lending from other people, we need to payback the money that person so we can not being chase like a thief.'
p73
aS'For me i choose to invest now in bitcoin because right now bitcoin has a great value and we can earn huge amount of profit by putting money only in our online wallet, and also its good to invest now in altcoin because now their value is decreasing and it is good to hold and wait for the right time to sell it.'
p74
aS"Few altcoins that grew much higher in value in a very short time period have now decreased, so it's good to invest on those altcoins. Also this month end several ICO programs too was going on, perfect planning and investing could get you a good profit. On the whole bitcoin price is in a stabilized range so holding in wallets is good and gives a security for the amount."

p78
aS'Indeed essentially for profit or folding the duplicate money should require a plan or apparent reason. Because it is concerned about money, where any money already entered in an incorrect hal will deliver results that fail or do not match expectations. Look for potential or risk as much as possible from any place or thing that you want to use, so if you are very sure of one such place, at least already has a provision so as not to get a lot of losses\xc2\xa0'
p79
aS'Yes investing in altcoins is the best place to invest your bitcoins instead of investing in any doubler or cloud mining sites where the chances of loosing your money is pretty high and if you are good in trading then you can expect regular profits from it.'
p80
aS'Bets are too risky for profit, because you can lose all the coins in case of failure. It is better to invest a little in other coins for quick profits.'
p81
aS'Yes its better not to risk our bitcoins by investing them in gambling sites as you never know what will be the end result so the best place to invest at a moment is to invest in different altcoins and wait for the price to pump to make profits from it.'
p82
aS'try to build a mining rig, only you have to do is to build a computer rig and buy a high specs graphics card and connect it to each other, you will earn a lot to this, if only you are persistent , determined and be patient thats is all the thing you must to do. you dont need to risk, because you do not need to put an investment here.'

p84
aS'You have a small investments to begin with so the return is also small. Have you tried trading in Poloniex instead of just lending it out. Try trading in alt-coins maybe you can get a good return you just have to me very careful on what coins to invest or trade. Or try also investing in a on-line casino gambling site. Some of them gave good returns but you have to invest it long term to really enjoy the profit. You should look for sites that are trusted and established already in the business and see how they are giving shares to their investors. GoodLuck.'
p85
aS'I agree with you, now it makes sense to trade in some alternative coins. For example, DASH went up very much in February. It is necessary constantly to follow the news in order to successfully trade'

p88
aS'I think investing in legit you gambling casino is one of the good place where we can invest it not so risky but expect that you can be lose.. For now the good thing the best you can invest your money is the place where many people are staying like trading site which is you need knowledge in order to make a good profit. .'
p89
aS"Point is to only stick to the sites that have been running for years with a solid reputation. It will not mean that you will walk out with profits, but you'll have far less to worry about, that's for sure. Reward versus risk ratio is relatively okay as on average you'll be making like 5-10% in profits per year (assuming the site's bankroll won't get drained after your investment). I personally don't find it worthwhile. I generate far better returns with just some occasional trading at days with enough volatility. This year alone I already sit above 30%, and we have many months left."
p90
aS"There is no best return but lowest risks. If you want the best return then you have to take the risk higher. The only low risk that I can suggest to you is to lend that to trusted people here on forum but it's up to you on how you will make your own rule of lending. You can also trade with that amount just buy those good alts."
p91
aS'Lending is very risky, and i do not think higher ranked in this forum would need a loan. I think much better to do is trading you can lessen the risk if you trade only in trusted altcoin and also you need to have enough knowledge in this method.And i recommend to avoid gambling this method is not good for users who only want is to earn with small capital this method is for rich people and they only want is entertainment or enjoyment.'
p92
aS'If your in trading altcoins mate why not buying a bot. Invest in Gunbot software. The bot is 0.10 BTC and you will have a automated trading and will help you increase your earnings. '
p93
aS"Lending is very risky and if you're not careful you could also lose all your money and might not able to payback the money you've loanYou could just have earn a good amount of BTC by joining in a sig campaign in this site but since you have lend some BTC you could try to trade it but first do some research on how it is done, I also dont suggest gambling. "
p94
aS'I feel the opposite. Lending while taking proper care, such as asking for a collateral that can be sold for equivalent or future value is a very profitable business, as people with bitcoin tend to pay a much higher interest than banks. '
p95
aS'Just invest it into the legal business like for example gambling site, but make sure that business you want to join or open is supported by legal papers. Because if not, in the future instead you earn Bitcoin you lose everything, even your capital that you want to have an income.'
p96
aS'Correct investing in gambling bankroll is good but you should invest in trusted gambling sites to make sure your return of investment are secured. and much better to invest only the amount of money that you can afford to lose what ever happen you do not hurt too much and you can move on easily.'
p97
aS'In my opinion there is no low risk best returns for you to earn but you can minimize loss in time of having a good skills.Having any investment is a total risk that is why we risk to earn .I recommend trading or having a real business .Lending is good in polo and it is best instead of staking your bitcoins.'
p98
aS'if you really want the best tip you will receive.DONT INVEST IN ANYTHINGinstead buy more bitcoins, I have made quite a bit being an early adopter and holding on to coin is worth more now than back then, imagine 10 years from now, if you invest, your really converting bitcoin into fiat and getting a return on that, lets assume your choice of investment does not disappear like all the other investment opportunities, and lets further assume that it makes enough money to return some yeald, how will earning $100 a year equate to bitcoin doubling in that same year? even if not in a year, beleive this statment to be more true than any investment.bitcoin will all ways have its ups and down, but it cannot do anything in the long term, other than be more valuable in time.can you say that about an investment..........learn!'
p99
aS"Hold bitcoin is a good investment, but many members here don't have initial money to invest, and they want to grow their money faster than just holding. For them I think sites paying interest are the best investment.Like the lending service, the profit will be higher than just hold, what do you think?"
p100
aS'yes I do see what your saying, but lending has its own pitfalls, unless you can find a middle man to cover possible losses if lender does not pay back, I dont know anyone that would do that, and many lenders lend their own funds.the only other way around is to lend in fiat currency (do your dealings in cash only) and when a profit is made, buy bitcoins, so all your profit is in BTC, that way your earnings will still continue to grow.'
p101
aS"Yes lending is very risky that's why you are just going to lend your bitcoin to those people that are trusted here in the forum. Just make sure that you know who are those people. Because there are some that are also imitating the names of the trusted people here for the hope that they can try to scam someone with that type of borrowing."
p102
aS"It's always risky to give a loan. And those people whom you trust too. They may have unforeseen circumstances. It is better to come up with another way of investing - maybe in stocks or other securities"
p103
aS'Currently just investing bitcoins is not good option if you can keep for sometime its also very good option because price is roaring and if you can keep eye on this then you can take some good profit but you must read analysis about this and need to have some good eye on price also '

aS"That's why you are trusting those people because you know that they are going to pay you. And if they have a good pay history from their loans they why you aren't going to trust them your money if you know that they are good payers? But if you think that this isn't the right choice, then you can invest in bitvest.io "
p105
aS'even they have good credit history instead the risk are remain. Lending is always need a collateral to make sure your capital will not lost! what ever happen if creditor will not pay you have still an income by their given collateral!'
p106
aS'My mind has made the same analysis as you did, buying bitcoins with fiat for a short term, or daily trading is not such a good option right now.The price is simply too high if we consider the history of BTC, it is over 1300$ which seems for me that it is even overvalued lately.The infrastructure of the network is still not ready for the prices above 1200$ (that is only my opinion), because as we can see sometimes we have spam-attack, and the whole blockchain is literally stuck.We cannot see so many unconfirmed transactions during big traffic, it is just too harmful for bitcoin and BTC users. Without solution, price cannot really get increased constantly, unless something different is going to happen.'
p107
aS'People here are enough matured and we are not looking for quick rich programs. You are a newbie and I believe no one will mind your story. Instead of trying to deceive people here, think about working in legit way, definitely you will never have hard times.I never tried to invest my bitcoins as I just want to save them securely. Before I used to invest with cloud mining, but after some bitter experience I completely stopped that too.'
p108
aS'You could always do your own research and pick an altcoin which you think would be a low risk investment.'
p109
aS"Looking altcoin with low risk investment were too hard. Because all altcoins we're fluctuate in the market. Also I suggested that investing to gambling site was the best idea I've known due to gambling sites were earn double of your capital monthly."
p110
aS"In my opinion beside the Poloniex\xe2\x80\x8b , no one is better exchage that can give you perfect internet to give loan of your bitcoin , here no doubt that you have no risk at all to loss your money .Never go for another site for lending bitcoin ( for example btcjam ) Because most of the sites are legit but the users are scammer Because one of my friend got scammed at btcjam where I gave 0.6btc at loan to a person but he didn't returned .My advice for you is that Invest in that altcoin in which Chances to increase are more according to the market of cryptocurrency ."
p111
aS'Investing in different altcoins is the best choice to make at a moment as altcoin market is full of pump and dump so if you choose the right coin at the right time and sell it at right time then you can make huge profits from it in short term.'
p112
aS'I am Invested in an Investment with MeCoin. The CEO is well known in the cryptocurrency sector and the investment has 3 streams of income.

p113
aS"The risk will remain but if you are going to allow those people here in forum that has a big trust score and history of trading, you will not have to worry about the risk. It's up to you if you want some collateral but there are some that really doesn't give collateral and if they insists, it's your money and your decision as a lender will still be followed."
p114
aS"Of course, it's not even surprising that investing in Bitcoin will bring a good profit. But where exactly to invest Bitcoin is already the second thing. It is necessary to find out which projects are more suitable for investment and at the same time to avoid fraud, you need to learn more information."
p115
aS'Investing always deals with long term but altcoins are just good for only short term. I mean to say altcoins maybe good for some people who are trading them but definitely not for the investors who will be holding their investments for some longer haul.For investment considerations altcoins never be an option because almost all the altcoins get dumped over time they may bounce back or may not, but we should not take risk by investing with them.'
p116
aS'for me if you invested on bitcoin and want to get profit on safe place is just poloniex rightnow...even if interest % just around 0.5% - 1% daily you can still sure you get 10% up from your bitcoin monthly if you lending your btc there....daily loan request there allways 100btc up...you dont need to take care about colateral etc and 100% you will be payed plus interestthis is some profitable ways rather than you let your btc sit still '
p117
aS"If you are asking where exactly to invest bitcoin then you should read the quoted message you did coming from me. I'm suggesting to invest it into a lending business or build your own. And for the projects that you are saying, you should be specific as there are a lot of projects existing in the market right now and it looks like a lot of them are legit. "
p118
aS'I think this is not the best idea to invest bitcoin since bitcoin is accepted many merchant you can to use your bitcoin in your skills or for your study learn internet marketing many online are coaching to you for free live in webinar you can just found them in google if you want to learn that skill.. They are teaching you to buy a domain learn to make a landing page choosing a best offers to\xc2\xa0 promote.. if you have bitcoin you can use them for buying domain and hosting and earn that i think if you invest your money in your self its more chance to make a profit and low chance to loose or scam by anyone.. since you are investing your money or bitcoin to your self.. like i heard one of the favorite company peerfly are paying in bitcoin right now so spending few of your bitcoin for domain and hosting you can make\xc2\xa0 a good money in peerfly.. So skill still the best to choose than investing for many project that you will not know if it will success or not.. unlike spending and investing your money to your self you have more chance of success if you invest it to your own skills.'
p119
aS'You can invest your bitcoin on legit site like MPAC.You can also trade you bitcoin.'
p120
aS"There's a lot of business that who accept bitcoin as currency. But it's up to you, if what business you want to invest your bitcoin. Because for me, If you asked where I put my investment, I just put it into to the gambling site. Due to gambling site is one of the most earner business in every country. "
p121
aS'Good strategy. The main thing is not to start gambling. An investor is less risky than a player. But still there is a risk, because this is a dangerous business'
p122
aS'The easiest way is to research into good Alt-coins and invest in them. GAME is up 30%+ just today, for example. The is money to be made, you just to do your due diligence.'
p123
aS'I did this before but finally I faced losses more than what I have booked earlier. Maybe over time I started failing with my researches but till today I could not find exact reasons for my losses. Currently I am not recommending anyone to go investing into altcoin trading.But I am not seeing gambling business a dangerous one for the gambling owner/investors. I guess gambling industry will turn as trillion dollars industry in very near future itself.'
p124
aS'As @Drago pointed out investing in gambling will always be less risky for the investor than the player simply because of inconsistency in howplayers bet and that recipe of greed that is always there...It should be safe to invest in established gambling companies provided you do some researchin knowing who you getting in business with!'
p125
aS'Gambling is one of the biggest risks that you plan to invest, so try to research about an investment where you will make good money. I hope trading is one of the best investment where you can make decent money if you know the analytical knowledge.'
p126
aS'There is no such place. Lowest risk = lowest returns. Btw 0.1 btc is very low amount to invest and expect high returns. '
p127
aS'So far i dont see any investment with high return and have a less risk.If u only have 0.1 in ur wallet go to trading altcoins, but u need knowledge about the coin and u must choose when to buy and sell ur altcoin. Good luck sir'
p128
aS"It doesn't really exist on this world which an investment with have high returns with less risk and knowing all of that kind of investments are mostly scam which means we should really be careful on selecting on where would gonna put our money.Trading is a good choice but depending on how you gonna execute it because if you do trade with less knowledge then you are likely do gambling."
p129
aS'It seems to me that the very work or lessons of the crypto currency, including Bitcoin, is already a fairly strong gambling game. But if Bitcoin brings a good profit it really would be beneficial to invest in a real business or even real estate.'
p130
aS'Many people are making good profits by trading altcoins but that is possible only if you have good knowledge about the market and if you hold a good experience of trading as there are many people who invest blindly without collecting any information and end up loosing everything but if you have good skills and knowledge then investing in altcoins is the best thing to do.'
p131
aS"It's better to trade with alt coins with that amount and you can buy bulk of alt coins that you can have good profit one day. Just take the risk, whether it is high or not but remember that the capital you are going to invest will have equal effect for the profit, if you invest low, you'll get low. Don't expect it will be higher."
p132
aS'Yes higher capital will give\xc2\xa0 you higher profits but even the risk would be higher but that can be managed if you are really looking to make good profits in short term and that is possible with altcoin trading so before investing do a good homework and choose the right coin at a right time for making an investment.'
p133
aS'The risk will be bigger but once you started to earn good amount in trading, you are the one to say that you want to keep on going. That will be only hard in the first place but if you are able to earn decent profit there still you need to keep on studying the market of alt coins. When it comes to risk, lending is riskier.'
p134
aS"That's correct it will be only harder at primary stage when you are new to trading but once you make good profits and once you get used to it you will start taking higher risks and once you have acquired a good knowledge of trading it won't be much difficult for you to understand the market and you will take your decisions accordingly."
p135
aS'So for us to be\xc2\xa0 knowledgable more on tradings well much better to do is t0 read some articles,thread arguments,youtube vids and devs status and so by that if we know on what is happening on them surely we can easily get rid on dying coin and earn some profits with it. Wise decision making is pretty important in tradings since their are so many false fuds spreading in that ecosystem.'
p136
aS"There are only three investments that I can suggest to you. First, is to buy those alt coins that can have chance to pump.Next is to invest to casino's that has the reputation and can help you to get some profit while they are pumping.And last is just do nothing but to keep on holding so that you can get profit."
p137
aS'I would not suggest you to invest in shitcoins as they can go dead anytime and take all your money in a blink.Investing in a casino is a good option and will yield you some returns for sure.Holding Bitcoin became one of my favorite hobby nowadays..\xc2\xa0 '
p138
aS'I guess he does not mean about playing , he means about the investment in gambling is putting the money in gamble but the purpose is to roll the money into the site, yes it is very nice strategy because rolling your money in gambling site is good as long as the site is lively and have a daily players around.'
p139
aS"In the long run trading is profitable and it is impossible that you will not learn when you started to trade. Because in the end that is going to give you profit that you never had before. And the more risk that you are going to take in trading by buying different alt coins that is going to give you better output where you'll say that trading is the best."
p140
aS'Yes when you will start to trade then you will start to learn but stay alert that not you learn each time with a lose. Trying different coins is better but before investing in any coin make sure that this coin is not a dead coin or is not running by a scammer. In long term you will earn with trade.'
p141
aS"Trade should be taken seriously. Some think that this is easy money. But they are wrong. Investing takes less time, but it's risky activity"
p142
aS"Investing altcoins is better than put your investments in the casino or gambling. It will double but it's so risky to handle. Most of the people involved in gambling see the loss only. Therefore, don't suggest this option for anyone especially newbies. In Eth project you can invest your bitcoins. The price of the eth also been increased with the bitcoin but I will suggest to try in bitcoin trading or open your gambling project if you have big funds."
p143
aS'Trying different coins is good but it is going to be a better move if you are going to choose only the best coins. Study on know what are the ones that can give you better profit, because in the end you will realize that not all coins are profitable and instead of earning, you will have the time to regret that you invested.'
p144
aS'disclaimer not an investment advise. just a suggestion. you can try ICO there are some good ICO for example BAT that is if you can get in quick or MobileGO. wish you best of luck.'
p145
aS'ICO is a better suggestion but before joining any ICO we should check that the ICO will not be scam and we have to look that the developers will be active for the coin and they will give success of the coin and in the future with their help the price of their coin will increase by increasing the demand.'
p146
aS"sometimes make investment in any ICO can make us big profit but we need to check the details in their journey so we don't feel sadly if in someday after the ICO is finished, the coins is not gettin success like they want. we need to make sure that the ICO is really good so we can trying to invest with them."
p147
aS'To avoid being scammed on ICO the first thing is to know who are the escrow of the project its better if the escrow is trusted already. ICO are very profitable nowadays and investor has the responsibilites to know more about the project'
p148
aS'Exactly,knowing the person who is responsible for escrow is best to avoid getting scam.if people are thinking of investing ,then invest in zr coin,as it is first commodity based virtual coin and it is escrower are Sasha Ivanov ,etc.'
p149
aS'Many thanks for the many responses in this thread.Yes I originally said invest 0.1 bitcoins because as a beginner I do not want to invest the whole capital into something that I have not done a risk assessment of so 0.1 btc is ideal for beginners like me i guess. Once the risk assessment is done then the investor can feel more comfortable increasing his/her capital.One risk I can think of straight away is investing bitcoins into a site that can be hacked or site goes bust or anything meaning btc is lost and gone.'
p150
aS"Then just invest to those websites or exchanges that are reputable. Don't worry about it because there are tight securities that are being built by those websites and they might be hacked because everyone is prone. But I know they are doing something just to strengthen their security. And 0.1 is already a good amount for beginners, good luck with your journey."
p151
aS'Just be careful in\xc2\xa0 investing to different sites,\xc2\xa0 why not do a little research on the invesment site you wish to join to. It will lessen the risk and being scam. Goodluck on your journey hope youll find a good invesment site.'
p152
aS"If you doesn't have the mentality to risk yourself bitcoin doesn't suits you. Bitcoin is full of risk factors which can be easily overcome by the users effort. Whether it might be investing or earning, risk always accompanies. So make you mind and research about the investment websites. There are legitimate investment site with high security, but won't get paid as the scam sites advertise."
p153
aS'Initial coin offerings are only good if they are backed by venture capitalists. That gives assurances that the project is real and the developers will not run away which was sometimes the case for the smaller ICOs.I dont think MobileGO and BAT are good ones but please argue and tell me why Im wrong.'
p154
aS"I don't understand on which aspects you have quoted that ICO's are not profitable. To some extent it happens with the ICO's that in between the entire development team gets hidden or sometimes the campaign won't run properly which is an failure of the cryptocurrency. In recent times creditbit is gaining potential and moving within certain digits."
p155
aS"Yes, I think investng on casinos would give you a higher % returns than poloniex but I can't say that they have the same risk. Besides only few casinos or gambling sites are accept investment and yet it is difficult to find a legit investing sites."
p156
aS'What sites are you talking about?If you\'re referring to HYIP sites, would be better to stay away and never touch that sites ever.If you choose trading/ICO, make sure your credentials are safe to avoid "hackers" stole your data also deposit on the trusted site as well.'
p157
aS'trading is best for btc invest. other you can like revenue share site.'
p158
aS"Truly it is. But trading doesn't always give you profit. Unless you are a professional trader. Another way of investing your Bitcoin is by investing in gambling bankrolls, this will not give much profit as trading does, but it give guarantee that your money will not be lost unless invested in a scam gambling sites. Here are the two gambling sites in which I consider safe to invest; Crypto-games.net , Betcoin.agNow, investing in ICO projects is also a great way to invest your money. There are lots of projects apprearing right now and almost all of the are successful. Projects like Encryptotel collected about $4.5M in just a time frame of two weeks, whereas Humaniq ICO collected for about $5.1M during its crowdsale. Try have a look at the Altcoin Marketplace Section and have a try at least one ICO and see how it benefits you."
p159
aS"I think you can never find an investment with a good or best return with a lower risk you'll always dealing with a high risk if you want a good returns but that doesn't sure that you can surely make a profit it's just like getting involved with HYIPS or ponzi which is not really trustworthy and that kind of investments are only for the high risk takers . the only good investment I know is bitcoin investment which you are just going to keep your coin for a long term until the value becomes higher ."
p160
aS'I agree, if OP wants a good return on his investments he should be willing to take a higher risk othherthan that hold and wait for bitcoins to go to the moonYou can add investing in altcoins to your list of which am here to tell you that you can stake your creditbit altcoins in your own ledger wallet \xc2\xa0and get a return based on how long you stake them.Look here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1237511.0 or https://www.creditbit.org'
p161
aS"Joining some promising ICO's is also good and for btc/alt coin trading is the best way to invest your bitcoins. But I can suggest another thing to you, you may want to invest that into a reputable casino like bitvest or you can choose also crypto-games.net they are one of those casino's that has built trust in bitcoin gambling."
p162
aS'In what part of my post did I say that it will not be profitable when the holders of the ICO tokens dump as soon as they are available in an exchange?What I was trying to talk about is the long term prospects of the project and the possibility that some of them might become a scam. If a venture capitalist is also a backer of the project theres less chance that its a scam.'
p163
aS'I believe you need to diversify your investments between altcoins, as there is the easy to trade, you can try casinos bankrolls as well, there are a few trusted around, in the last option maybe build your project with your bitcoins.'
p164
aS'There is no good sites in the internet to invest your bitcoin. The internet is now full of scammers . For me you better to save your bitcoin and sell it if the price goes up.'
p165
aS"There are good sites to invest, just need to search well. Avoid Ponzi and HYIP schemes. Most scam investments offer too high returns in small time period, the legit investments will offer few percentage of returns, but it's safer and worth if you have a good amount of capital to invest. Check casino bankroll investments, it's so far the best option I found on the internet."
p166
aS'Agreed, the btc lending very_452001 was doing is the only safe option out there and the returns contrary to what he says are actually quite good, most people will earn up to 50% in btc every year, combined with the fiat rise thats a huge profit. Theres no way to double your btc on a weekly/monthly basis without being 99.9% sure of losing it all.'
p167
aS'for me bro just stay on POLONIEX theres alot of chance to profit if you can read the chartsyou just need to learn how to read charts and learn to trade your coins or alt coinsin poloniex your money is safe than the investment SITESinvestment is RISKY so if you dont want to loss your money dont go on investment sitejust TRADE ....'
p168
aS'How high are the returns the BTC casinos give you? Are they high enough to double your investment in 1 year?'
p169
aS"I want to invest my bitcoin in gambling because if I invest it in gambling site I'm sure that I was earn income. Because from now there's a lot of people who gambled because they want to earn money/bitcoins easily. But in the end they were lose due to greediness to have a high income."
p170
aS'Doubling your investment in a year is near to impossible mate. If the OP has experience in lending then it would be a good idea to try lending service in here. It is riskier but more profitable than poloniex. '
p171
aS"Of course it isn't possible to double your money through investing in casino bankrolls. It's nearly impossible to say how much you would net after a year. Mainly because of the fact that you depend on the casino to make profit. It may very well be that in the period that you invest the casino in question is losing slightly -- resulting in you to lose as well. On average (if things play out well for the casino) I say that 10% per year is quite achievable."
p172
aS'Do you run an active lending service or have any experience in running one? How much is the difference in earnings in running the riskier one here in the forum compared to using the lending feature on an exchange like Poloniex?'
p173
aS'If your plan is to make money only from gambling then that is a really worst plan as most of the times you will loose your money in it but if you invest in some good casino sites then you can expect some profits from it and the amount of profits will depend on the amount of capital you invest.'
p174
aS'At the forum there is some people able to make much more then if they were trying to lend over poloniex, lend 0,01 and take 0,012 in 1 or 2 weeks, something if you try lend at poloniex you wont get no where similiar results.But if i had some knowledge i would risk over trading wich can bring amazing results, and in the end maybe i would try bankroll of casinos.'
p175
aS'The best place to invest your bitcoins is on trading platforms from where you can make regular profits depending on the knowledge and skills you have to make profits and that is the best way to make good profits in quick interval.'
p176
aS'Investing with low risk attached, and high profit expectation, such sites are are too scarce to see if there is any.Invest with any possible amount that will not distable you, and expect anything , but the good expectation will be of more help.'
p177
aS'After browsing the last 2 pages of the thread I still think the ICO market is now good to invest in. We should go into it while its hot because you will never have the same opportunity as this if the government starts banning them. '
p178
aS'Well this is just my own opinion invest in ICO for me still not a good idea because 3/10 are legit.. they are just few legit but most of them are scam.. Except if you can analyze the background of those altcoin.. Well for me i just choose altcoin that already live for a long time and there are in top ranking most of them are in top 20 rankings that can gives you good\xc2\xa0 profit if you can hold them for a long time..'
p179
aS"There's none, don't hope for an investment to offer low risk but with high return because of the expectations that you are looking for. Just invest to the usual way of investment like the popular one which is trading and bankroll casino."
p180
aS"Hi you all, I am new, and maybe late, in the Bitcoin's world and exchanges,\xc2\xa0 and I was wondering which exchange market's chart like Bitcoin Wisdom, coinmarketcap or data.bitcoinity do you use in order to choose the best exchange to trade with your bitcoin and alternative coins. I have bitcoin, dogecoin and litecoin and I do not exactly where to compare the different exchanges and where to trade with my alt. coins.Thanks a lot!"
p181
aS'I suggest that you check out poloniex.com . it is the site where I trade and has a big volume everyday. lots of traders are trading their but be aware that in the past few days, ddos attacks where held so better review first before you deposit your funds there.'
p182
aS'u can invest crpto.. and buy top coin and hold this..when coin price high u can sell this...this best way to earn btc..I hope'
p183
aS'Low risk involved and a high profit expectation not too many of such projects exist but good suggestion would be creditbit an Ethereum ERC 20\xc2\xa0 Tokenthat rewards owners with an interest for locking their creditbits for a certain period of time and earn an interest in form of bond yields or votes.'
p184
aS"There's none trust me. Where can you find that an investor will have an advantage to this type of investment where he will not worry about the possible profit that he can get while the risk is very low, there's no such investment like that. Well creditbit is another promising project, you can invest your bitcoins there for good."
p185
aS"Yeah even ICO's have high risk.\xc2\xa0 But as they say, the higher the risk the bigger the reward we can get.\xc2\xa0 Or probably invest in an idle coin that have active developer and had been around for some years. There is always a good possibility that this coin will pump or increase in price ."
p186
aS"Yeah all of the investments does have the risk so don't be confident that you will be getting nice results at the first place. And even just for holding bitcoin you are still taking up a risk from it. But the guarantee is there and it will all depends on what you are going to choose."
p187
aS'Most of them may not be legit but most of them can give you 10 times your original investment in under a year. Who says we will keep holding it forever. We know almost all of them are only good for making more BTC for us.'
p188
aS'I agree , I invested on many ICO many times and I havent been scamed for a time. I review the ICO first before I invested to make sure I wont be scammed. Im checking for the team members . If I see old members who participated a successful ICO I invested to there team again.'
p189
aS"Analyzing an ICO is tidious task and you have to verify many possible issues and factors. Most of the ICO's are shady and without proper details about its developers or their social media profiles. Be very cautious before investing into them. Hold you BTC or invest in some altcoins which may shoot up in future. "
p190
aS"I feel the same as you. in these days ICO and gambling seem to be close enough because if you look at it there are a bunch of people getting scammed on icos compared to the ones who's coin they invested in keeps their promise and proceed to the actual plan. there are many icos which i see some potential but i rather put my money on a established altcoin because its less risky, more chances to gain profits . "
p191
aS'you can trade your bitcoin, better than investing the bitcoin, investing bitcoin have high risk than your trade yourself.#minexcoin.com'
p192
aS'What ICOs have you invested in in the past? Which one was the most successful and which one was the least successful? '
p193
aS'You can try do trading but you need more knowledge before before start trading ,\xc2\xa0 trading its risky also but you can prevent this by doing research before buying altcoin so you can know who coin have potential to increase. You can earn bitcoin weekly if you do that but you need more capital in trading to earn good amount. You dont invest in hyip or ponzi because all of this are scam the founder run after few hours and few days only and your bitcoin gone if you choose that yes other people earn bitcoin in hyip is very less compared to the people lost their bitcoin because of this.'
p194
aS'Investing in HYIPs is very dangerous. I myself lost money several times in HYIP. Now I do not believe in this passive source of income. Can someone get there to make money on referrals, but not meIt seems to me that trade is less dangerous'
p195
aS"I just wonder on seeing people still preferring about HYIP programs. When people are ignoring to learn from other's experience, they must need to face their fate and frustrations. Do not under estimate HYIP owners to tackle to earn within first one or two days, they may start scamming from first hour also.Affiliate programs are always legit and effective way of earning. But yo need to make sure you are not entering into any MLM programs. Because people do fail to identify legit affiliate programs from MLMs."
p196
aS'Many ICO in the forum, study the most reliable and invest'
p197
aS'I dont sugest ico because the most of them will be just a dump before a pump, or something like those, i would invest into altcoins that are quite atractive to invest there is a risk but without risk no reward, soo you need to search the code and see if its worthing to invest or no.'
p198
aS"If you ask here everyone will share their past experience so it's better to learn things by yourself because in beginning it will be very tough to learn but once you are familiar where to invest your bitcoin. Because now there are many options for investing bitcoin like trading, gambling, altcoin trading etc. Everything depends on the experience you have."
p199
aS"If he need to gather a experience in each filed first he must to learn via the details information from you or others sharing their experience about the concern fields. Even in gambling all time winner will have tactics to be on top. If he learns using shared knowledge in forum that's enough to start up earning method with or without investment."
p200
aS"Why not to suggest ICO's? we know that most of the people are into ICO's and on that way it is giving them more profit. And as you join those ICO's you will have chance to earn too. ICO's are working that way so you don't have to think about it will be dumped after the pump while there's a pump take the advantage on investing there."
p201
aS'yes that is right one can really get good profit from ICOs as ICOs offers special discounts and some time give\xc2\xa0 some extra coin in ICO therefore investing in ICOs is a good decision, but you must keep it in your mind that there are so many ICOs which are scam and that can take your money sway, therefore you need to be too much careful. '

aS"Yeah the discounts and bonuses that they are giving for the early comers or investors is one of the great feature of ICO's. There were a time that I don't trust ICO's because there are some that are turning out to scam but I learned that it's our duty to learn deeper about them so that we will know if they are real for their project."
p203
aS'Figuring out that an ICO from a certain project is legit, is just one aspect of the whole. No matter how many time you put into researching how legit a certain project is, there is no guarantee that it will be profitable to you and others. There are enough examples of how legit minded ICO projects have gone down and are now eating dust. Result is that people end up holding a bag with worthless tokens/coins.'
p204
aS'Its just us if we will trust the project and invest in their ICO , Im investing to an ICO that has a whale investors that invested on the first day. First of all I am researching about the team and doing a research on which ICO before that they have participated and who make successful ICO.'

p210
aS"Holding is a good way to make profits in future as it doesn't involve any risk of loosing but it can double your profits only if price goes higher in future so instead of simply holding it it would be much wise to use it in trading to grow bitcoins in long term as if you choose right coin at a right time then you can double your investment even in a single day depending on the pumps in the price of altcoins."
p211
aS'Invest you bitcoin in trading, this method is much better as of now, Choose coin which has potential to increase its value to make more income. I only advise is not too greedy and invest what you can afford to lose.'
p212
aS'It would be better if we invest in multiple coins instead of putting all money in single coin as we can get clear picture about the movement of altcoins from coinmarketcap so looking at that we can select top 5 altcoins and invest in it so even if one coin fails we can expect certain profits from other coins.'
p213

p215
aS"Though investing into altcoins is quite risky, because it's not sure whether the altcoin survives long or gets out of usage in a short. Why altcoin investment is suggested is because with the increase in the bitcoin price it's possible to invest a better value on altcoin. So the loss too won't be big even when the alt doesn't pump high."
p216
aS"I see many arguments in favor of investing in alternative coins, but still I do not trust them. It seems to me that they are less stable than bitcoin. So I decided to just keep bitcoin. Maybe I'm just a coward."
p217
aS"I don't think that its late to invest in altcoins, there are still potential alts you can trade. Just make sure to research and ask help from people you trust. And i guess you don't need to invest somewhere else as btc is rising, i guess you can just hold it for long term. "
p218
aS'You have the point, most of them are just good in the first place and really trying to collect as much as they can.

You can learn the coin that is upcoming in tokenmarket then decide what you think the most profitable. '
p220
aS'Joining ICO is one of the good choice but be careful invest only to those ICO that they project is good and they have potential to increase. After ICO you can some reward because you are one of the investor so your money can earn interest. If you want to sell your your token or coin after ICO you can sell it if you see the price is good but if you do research you can know if the coin that you have many potentian to increase or not. Joining ICO is better than trading.'
p221
aS'I always suggest whenever anyone ask me where i invest my bitcoin, than i reply, trading is best option to invest the bitcoin. Otherwise bitcoin has a good time about price increasing fastly, than better to hold it and if instead of it you want to utilize your bitcoin, than do altcoin trading, less than in trading you could earn everyday. '
p222
aS'I disagree with you. Trade can bring a lot of money. Especially if you have the experience and desire to earn.I do not think that joining ICO, you can earn a lot of money.'
p223
aS'I will agree to you, trading is the best option to invest. But you need to ask yourself first if you are ready to trade or do you have a background in trading? If you will trade, make sure that you are ready to trade so that your investment will not be wasted.'

p226
aS"It can worth, but in my opinion people shouldn't let their money in Alt Coins for much time. After trading the Alt Coins, when you stop doing this, exchange the money to BTC again, because if you let your money in Alt Coins you can lose good opportunities of pumps, like now. Bitcoin is the best currency and it's not adviced to convert funds to Alts..."
p227

p228
aS"They should be responsible for their investment if they are going to invest to alt coins. There are people that are trusting too much with alt coins as they believe it will generate good profit on them. For example, there is ETH , LTC and XMR are few examples of the best alt coins that many are investing and there's no regret on it when you sell at nice price."
p229
aS'i think investment in altcoin is great because i am sure if bitcoin price is moving high, the altcoin price is following too and the price will be increase too. but i think its still the best option to choose bitcoin as our investment because people know bitcoin as the king and altcoin is a support for bitcoin and help people to gain more bitcoin. maybe altcoin like ETH, LTC, XMR, DASH is a good choice to invest but still bitcoin is the best one.'
p230
aS'On thinking to invest on XMR well im kinda had a little doubts about that coin but for ethereum,LTC and dash well provably we can earn more by holding on that but my long time hold really is the ethereum and im little more starting up to hodl some ltc since it cathces my attention for little while.My addition of alts to stake are ICN and stratis since i Believe that this coin will get a high future someday.'

p234
aS' We have the same thought. It is better to keep all your bitcoin in your wallet and hold it for a long time. Today is the best time to hold your bitcoin because since its price grows faster. You can guarantee that you will earn a high profit and yet it has a low risk.'
p235
aS'Investing your bitcoin on atcoins is good idea but you should choose a right coin that you think have a chance to pump and has a large volume too like etherum. Since bitcoin has enormous price today you could buy a lot of altcoins.'
p236
aS'Lending, trading and arbitrage'
p237
aS'This investment is too risky and it takes big capital to earn big profit also. For me i just want to buy bitcoin right now and keep it to my wallet for long period of time and wait for the high increase of value of bitcoin to sell it and make profit. Simple as that.'
p238
aS"Continuous arbitrage is profitable but with the current differences of buy and sell rate of most of the exchanges.It's hard to do this, it's better if you will invest to trading and this is the most popular way of investing bitcoins by buying some good alts.And also you can just do nothing and keep on holding."
p239
aS"It's not safest at all because the price seems crashed right now but ETH is a long old altcoin so you don't be afraid for getting scammed or invest on shit coins but invest in ICO is much better because you can get bonus from there make sure you invest on the right coins."
p240
aS"Investing in overpriced premine tokens is a bad thing, but in the same way, investing in ICO's can be considered a bad thing as well. Seriously, how many times have ICO's turned into a profitable investment option? It's safe to say that the majority of the sold ICO coins end up in a big downfall after a while. Result is that people keep holding a heavy bag of worthless tokens in the hope that their value bounces back up.... I have said it before, and I'll say it again -- investing in ICO's is like gambling. It may work out well for the investors, but the chances are higher that it won't work out well."
p241
aS'Yes investing in alt coins is great you only need to choose those best alt coins. But there are some dead coins that sometimes someone is pumping it those whales are becoming crazy even a sleeping dead coin they are making it pump.

We just set up a lot of capital and after it bought the bitcoin on very low prices, save it in quite a long time until the price of the bitcoin is very high.

You live trying to find that information, will certainly get a lot of bitcoin\xc2\xa0'
p243
aS"Aside from that we need some side income genarating site where we can earn more rather than sticking on just 1 ideas here since we cannot earn pretty much good profit in that if we just wait for gods miracle and what if there's no pump will be happen? your money will be stuck for quite moment so seek those appropriate sites like tradings,Lending or maybe try to become a local or global exchanger that can make you earn a lot of money here."

p247
aS'yes that is right, holding bitcoin for a long time can\xc2\xa0 be much more profitable, because the price of bitcoin is increasing continuously. but in fact most fo the people cannot wait for such a long time and therefore i think it is more better to invest their bitcoin in altcoin from where they have good chances to make money in comparatively short period of time.

p358
aS'Joining bounty program is good. But I never recommend to go for investing into new altcoins as some random people come with some random purposes to launch new projects which are mostly ending up in scamming people. We must look for a concept based things to invest with. This way established altcoins are alone good to invest and all others are just suited only for trading. Investing your bitcoin is not at all recommended by many experts here.

You need to become strofer on those times because even holding is an easy thing it is still risky and you can lose if you loss the patience a holder needs."
p382
aS"This is true. The only problem here is that when the ICO is finished some are only finding some cash because they are selling their coins earlier to make up for the ICO price and then the return to them will be big. Only few investors have a heart to support the whole project and fight throughout the projects timeline in the next years until the project reached its goals.I have a little knowledge on what is cloud mining and computer hardwares and programming but I'm learning.

p389
aS'to me i think the best option is to invest money in ICOs and such kind of altcoins which have good potential and where there is more chance to make good amount of money, but for that you need to have regular study about the market of bitcoin. '

p394
aS"It's still if it does not stop much faster. Although I share your opinion and believe that in such a plan it would be much better for the future for all cryptography and users of crypto currency.

'
p398
aS'Yeah we know that lots of sites scamming their investors but there is an investment site which is really good to invest.

Do not look on the small value of coin most of them does not exist for long period of time.'
p399
aS"Why to invest in AltCoins if the Bitcoin is much more stronger on long term? I have no problem investing in AltCoins, but I think the biggest part of the money should be put into Bitcoin investment. AltCoins are too risky and their price don't increase like BTC price. When you see a big pump on AltCoin price from nothing you can have sure that is a fail currency and that if you invest on it you will just lose money..."

p404
aS'If we talk about trade for earning small amounts of money, then it seems to me that the exchange can be handled by anyone who is interested in this craft. Well, if you want to earn more, then you can not do without tactics and strategy, and you need to have a very large stock of knowledge next to you, which will give you the opportunity to trade on the stock exchange.

So as a trader i particularly recommend trading as a part of investment.'
p409
aS'What you say in my opinion is very risky. Investing in the wrong ICO can make you lose all the money you have, ICO is profitable but many are ending a scam. Besides that lend should be done by people who really understand the situation and how to work bitcoin, because if you do not understand maybe you will be fooled and can lose all money that you lend.'
p410
aS'The best places to invest nowadays are trading as well some ico, but be sure not all will assure you easy income, neither roi, trading will require some capital to dont let your coins too much time exposed, but if you choose the good coin sooner or later it will get a pump.'
p411
aS'Many options that we can make as a means for bitcoin investment, perhaps the most popular is to follow a lending site like btcjam, there is an attractive offer to get a rate of 5% interest per month.'
p412
aS' In investing in Bitcoin you should need to keep on your mind that all types and forms of investment that you may do in Bitcoin always do have risk. And you probably set your mindset to deal with all of those risk because in order to earn you should need to open on taking and making the most out of every opportunities you may take in your life. It just a matter of you management and will to earn and to be a successful trader and investor someday.'
p413
aS'I think there are some good projects but I think people think that just because they invested in an ICO they are going to get earnings and that is not the case you need to do your due diligence and see if the project actually has a chance to work, if you believe in the project then you can invest in it if you do not then forget about the project and look for something else.'
p414
aS'\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I suggest you bitdice ico, I invested already and if I have more money like I planed I will invest more, also I am in their signature campaign and I will get stakes from that too. They are trusted site, they are here for years and for me as a beginner in this world means a lot.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As you can see I invest my time and my money in them at the moment, while it is in early stages, and I see this as a long term investment, I do not plan to earn something right away. This site will be here for years and they can grow bigger and that will be good for all of us who invested in right time.'
p415
aS"Try to check the ANN section of alternate currencies and look for the initial coin offering there that has the potential to develop exponentially in the market over the long run. There, invest your bitcoins. But be advised that before you spend or put your money into something, study everything about it first. Read as many reviews and feedback about the coin you're investing and if possible, question the team behind it. Ask them for escrow; their plans in their roadmap; their programs and strategies to secure the coin's future, etc. If they can answer every question you have, then decide for yourself if you want to invest in it or not. As I see it, ICOs are the best place to invest your bitcoins especially if you want a huge return on your investment."
p416
aS'Ethtrade or Hashing24 ?Where is the good one to invest my bitcoin ?'
p417
aS'i suggest with you sir go to the site in the binary option academy you can get more knowledge about trading and you learn step by step about investment process until you can find a good idea where do you invest your bitcoin, i hope i can help you for my simple suggestion.'
p418
aS'Right now we have many possible options for investing Bitcoin but you have to face the risk, those who face risk will get more profit on the investment they made. So I hope trading is the best where you can make unexpected money with a little investment you are going to make.'
p419
aS'You can try do trading but you need more knowledge before before start trading '
p420
aS'I believe below should work%70 of your BTC, forget about them and check back laterr (2 years)%20 join some ICOS (1 or 2)%10 alt coin trade, buy low sell high.'
p421
aS'You can invest in an ICO program or on a gambling site that both have a variety of benefits you just calculate and choose according to the funds you would to invest.'
p422
aS'If the investment in any project provides some guarantees, then each user will agree to such investments. Even investing in gambling, only as an investment and not a gamble. I do not really want to play, but I would like to invest in the project with pleasure. Thanks to bitcointalk, a lot of projects can be found.'
p423
aS"On online world of investment mate you cannot find good guarantee and the thing do by most of people here is risking their money to gain. Bu their are low risk investment we can find here and that is trading nor investing at good ICO's but we should make sure that we've got fast hands to sell when hype is on on particular coins there."
p424
aS"That's a good percentage of allocating your total bitcoins to investments. 70% is a good portion of just storing your bitcoin and get back to it again for a year or even more. 20% joining with ICOs but those only the legit ones. And buy also some good alt coins but 10% I guess it is not enough if you want to get good profit."
p425
aS'Have a good look everywhere, however, I am not sure if you would receive much from that amount. You could hold or trade with it but it comes with risks as you may know.'
p426
aS'The good thing is you set a plan in your bitcoin, you already know where you put the portion of your bitcoin.Me even i have no whole bitcoin i always segregate my satoshi in multiple method that can generate income because by doing that is i can lessen the risk of my investment. And i have 5% of my satoshi in gambling to entertain me and together that i earn good amount on playing on gambling,.'
p427
aS"You can use your bitcoin to trade or join any altcoin ICO project in this forum but if you don't have any trading skills and can't find out which is the best ICO project to join I think you shouldn't take the risk and just keep your bitcoin for a few years then sell it with a good price "
p428
aS'There is zero legit project out there that provides a guarantee. There are companies out there that have secured some of their funds and thus can offer some money back guarantee, but not 100%. Anywhere you invest, they will always tell you to only invest as much as you can afford or that never invest what you can\'t afford to lose. This is very reason why basic scam websites use the term "100% money back guarantee" or something. They want their investors to have assurance and be confident on investing to them. Once they have ran away, you have nothing left to do but accept the fact that you got scammed.Seriously, how can a company that have lost money give you back your money? They\'ve already lost it (assuming that the project failed).'
p429
aS"Yes, if you wanna join trading you must accept the risk . But you can earn very quickly with trading or if you have big capital you can buy some bitcoin and just hold them for few years  the second way is safer but we can't know what will happen in the future but the bitcoin price is increasing very quickly "
p430
aS'Friends, this is not the official thread of freebitco.in so in here you will never get help directly by the relevant parties. It would be much better are you looking for official thread freebitco.in in order to get the handler as soon as possible. Indeed we must always try to about all the things you and if it is not done well everything is going to be a future that is slightly worse than the other. Because we underestimate the precious time\xc2\xa0'
p431
aS"It's a good plan but 0.1 BTC is too small, it's better to use most of the funds for altcoin trade"
p432
aS'i agree with this 0.1 Bitcoin for trading altcoins is way to small maybe if you can make it as 1 Bitcoin to trade buy hodl trade will be much easier profit rather than 0.1BTC you may loss as fee when you trade so its much better to make it a bigger capital and you may hodl some coins if you want too you can make it weekly monthly or yearly if your not in need as much. '
p433
aS'For sure into trading wich is the place where the most people are investing nowadays, could consider as well make some loans with a proper collateral soo risk would be near zero. Having bitcoin is already the best investment you can make, but If you wanna to take some risks to get more bitcoins altcoins is one road to sucess.'
p434
aS'You mean we can do a collateral method? How could that be? Yes, we can do trading not only that we can even sell it or buy. Bitcoin has many strategic way to offer in terms of investment. One thing that you have to stick with is the emotion that you have most of the time because it tests your patience if you can go through with the issues that surrounds the world of bitcoin. Make sure that you can take the risks before entering a particular investment. As you can see there are dropping issues in bitcoin. Fortunately, it also balances when the value pumps for quite some time. Needless to say, bitcoin is doing its duty from investors that engaged in this cryptocurrency world.'
p435
aS'I think it will be hard to find an investment with high returns and low risk. Investment, same as trading, has always risk on its back. Much better if you will invest that to crypto trading or alt coin trading. It will surely be risky but will also give you big profit. To lessen the risk in alt xoin trading, study the market value of the alt coins that you want. Make a research in short. In that way risk will be low.'
p436
aS'I think the best way to make profit is to not to invest to some non legit site especially when you do not know much about site. I myself avoid to make invest in some site, some projects around because some dumps after big investment comes to their wallet.But I use to make money in just keeping my coins in my wallet because it just grow and grow especially when the coin value is getting high, like what we are experiencing now.'
p437
aS"Invest them into trading. Of course you will have to work hard as you'll have to read a lot about currencies and check how their price changes, but once you'll know enough you will get a lot of profit, as trading is probably best way to earn more besides gambling, but gambling is too risky."
p438
aS'precisely, in the ico investment we can get much faster compared to investments in cryptocurrency. Because in the ICO we still have the opportunity to be able to get a much higher price of ICO, if indeed at the launch of the project work or good or even much better than the ones in plan. So, we must be good at choosing the team that makes a project, for a solid team definitely has a greater profit level\xc2\xa0'
p439
aS'You will receive that much if you will invest and have a good look in "everywhere". Trading is a good source but you have to take the risk but it\'s worth to take than to gamble your bitcoins. But if you want to be on the safer side then you can just hold your bitcoins as the price of bitcoin gets higher just keep on holding your coins.'
p440
aS"The best option right now is ICO project and trading but It's not easy . If you wanna invest your bitcoin in any ICO project you must have experience to know what is the good one to invest in and also with trading  You can't do this two kind if you don't have any experience "
p441
aS"Trading is not an easy place to invest your bitcoin but it's the same as you hold bitcoin. Depending on how you would handle your trades, because my plan is to buy tenX and just hold it until it fly to the moon. If you choose to be a day trader then it will take a lot of time for you to monitor your coins."
p442
aS"Interested too in investing my bitcoins (or the tiny part of one, better said), but don't feel confortable with altcoins. So far the best I found is to hold them on freebitco.in where I get 0,01% daily interest. Is there a safe place that could do the same, or a little better, without the risk of losing money because of a bad guess of the market or a scam ICO project? "
p443
aS"That's difficult, to have a bigger profit with less risk. And preferrably, it would be better if you'll invest your Bitcoin to trading, which is risky but will surely give you a big profit. But to somehow lessen the risk, make a research about different coins to trade for you to have a background and to know which investment will give you big and assured profit."
p444
aS"Yes, altcoin investment can be an alternative to get bitcoin, but you should also be careful if you are misplaced to invest (scam), the possibility of your coins will be lost. Because I have experienced when investing in the wrong place and my coins are gone. So I think it's better to keep it, buy when the price goes down and sell when the price of altcoin / bitcoin goes up, that's where we get big profits."
p445
aS"Well, the place for me to invest is by lending traders on bitfinex and you will get a % of what you have given I have lent a few times and the profits were not that good but there your btc are safe.Also, keep in mind don't invest in Ponzi schemes that offer high profit in short term"
p446
aS'I don\'t think the coin will be "gone" at all if you invested in a scam coin. The coin will simply have very little to no value at all but it will not just vanish. Let yourself make mistakes and learn from it. But money is involved here, so you better actually learn from that mistake. If you want to not risk investing in a scam coin, then you should invest on altcoins that are there for a long time. Maybe invest on coins that are at the top 10 of the marketcap. ETH goes up and down these days, you can invest on that when it goes back to 0.067BTC each and then sell at, maybe, 0.08BTC. Your profit doesn\'t necessarily have to be a lot.'
p447
aS'Those profit-sharing programs from gambling sites and lending programs from exchange are really doing great for investors. The only thing we need to be careful here must be, choosing the right and reputed business. If we are good choosing the right one then we can enjoy passive income.Other than keeping our bitcoin safer, making our bitcoin to work for us to earn more bitcoin will be the right option for anyone. After cloud mining, this programs are good choice in my opinion.'
p448
aS'There are three places to invest, gamble wich is where the most bitcoins are nowadays, trading where people expose their coins into a litle risk and are able to make daily income with it, and Ico where you can buy a lot good and potencial coins for a cheap value, and with luck they will grow in value on the first months of life, soo taking all into consideration and choose the best for you.'
p449
aS"Gambling is also another helping hand for the bitcoin community. There is an option to invest in the casino's bankroll and I find this a very good idea, it's like the mutual funds in the stock market but it is as risky as other type of investments too."
p450
aS'In my opinion there is 2 safe methods to invest your bitcoins : either you hold them into your wallet for long term, so you make profit when the price increase, or investing in altcoins and ICOs, but you need to study this second choice because it is a bit risky.'
p451
aS'You should be able to invest with high capital in gambling'
p452
aS'the best investment method of your .1 BTC is to hold it at least 1 year or wait until reach 5k usd this year, but if you feel you are not convince in this method, try to diversify you .1 btc investment to other alt coins investment like NEO , ZCASH, Monero. Try this recommended investment strategy 30% BTC, 30% ETH, 20% other alt coins and 20% ICO investment.'
p453
aS"There's no such investment that is open for now and on going that has no high risk, they all are. Risk is normal, so let it just be and it is up to you now how to reverse the risk into profits. There some sites who have good reviews that doesn't worked the way they advertise, so be careful on that. I will not recommend any sites as of now but i might be in the future."
p454
aS"I think invest in ICO project or trading is the best way at this time but if you don't have any experience with this kind of invest so you don't know which ICO project is the good one you should invest in or which is the coin you should buy, I think you just need to hold your bitcoin till the price get higher "
p455
aS"Although I wouldn't highly recommend nor would I make lofty claims like it would make you rich but yes I would agree and say that investment in altcoins can be profitable and to some extent safer than investment in ponzi but you would be required to do lots of research yourself before actually investing your money in any altcoins."
p456
aS"I wouldn't call that 2 safe methods, rather one safe method. Investing in bitcoin(looking at charts) will give you profit in long term, just wait for more people to start using it. Investing in altcoins or ico's is on the other hand risky method, you have to pick right coin(or token) with great and active dev's team, choosing the right one is a bit hard. "
p457
aS'It is too late to invest in stratis it has pumped already, there may be some juice left but nothing that is going to bring you great profits I will probably wait for a another coin that is promising instead of investing in coin that is not going to go up for quite some time.'
p458
aS'If the return of investment will be big, expect that the risk is high. You may do altcoin trading, even if its a bit risky. But you may also lessen the risk by doing some background research about different coins to somehow avoid getting scamcoins or having small profits or even loss of money. You should also be patient, because profit will be instant in trading.'
p459
aS'I think that you should invest your bitcoin in altcoins if you do really want to make an investment. However, for me, bitcoin is the best investment right now and you do not need to do anything to earn more money  keep holding bitcoin and you will soon be awarded the prize which everyone wants'
p460
aS"I think the 'low risk, low gain;high risk high gain' still applies here since were talking about bitcoins. If you want high returns, you could try to lend bitcoin--goes without saying this has a high risk. Perhaps you could try trading, which is the common move for investors."
p461
aS'I think the best choice will be holding your bitcoins into your wallet, and its value will increase with time since the Bitcoin\'s price is already rising day per day almost. That\'s a lot better and safer than "investing" with third parties because nowadays there is a lot of ponzi and scam projects online.'
p462
aS'with .1 wort of bitcoin i guess if im with that balance i would buy some altcoins with good potentialits either a well established coin i guess i would go with bcc, lisk,exp,doge ,xvg or you can also go with new coins with good backup projects and success ico'
p463
aS"if you ask where is the best place to invest with a high returnand low-risk well it's a bit hard to find, because in every investment there are risks, it also depends on how much your investment, but if you want to get big profits better do it in long-term investments.but if you want to benefit immediately you can try it on the gambling site."
p464
aS'Altcoins for sure i would invest some bitcoin at altcoins, just look at ltc it has jumped from the 50 dollars and looks like isnt ready to stop grow at all, its interesting to see bitcoin up and ltc following it, segwit does bring a lot beneficts from both networks. But there are several others coins you should invest, not focus into single one, always diversify.'
p465
aS'Correct the only safe method is to buy bitcoin and hold for the long term everything else, from trading bitcoin to investing in alts or to invest in icos have a greater risk and with it the chance of losing money\xc2\xa0 are way higher, this is why more than anything I\xc2\x92m a holder of bitcoin and nothing more.'
p466
aS'and You can consider do investing but you need far more knowledge just before ahead of start buying and selling ,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 investing its risky also but you can avoid this by undertaking analysis ahead of acquiring altcoin so you can know who coin have potential to increase. You can make bitcoin weekly if you do that but you need more funds in investing to receive great quantity. You dont make investments in hyip or ponzi simply because all of this are fraud the founder run right after couple of hours and few days only and your bitcoin gone if you pick that yes other people earn bitcoin in hyip is extremely considerably less compared to the men and women misplaced their bitcoin simply because of this.'
p467
aS'IMO I rather to invest ICO, Like rigal coin this token have a potential, like bitconnect. '
p468
aS'many good and trustworthy sites are good payback and great but high risk just think about it over and over again before you invest in that site or you can also help with the forum too many truatworthy sites you choose'
p469
aS'there is many coins to invest your bitcoin , I advice you your bitcoin zith 3 coins or 4 coins for exemple you have 1 btc invest 0.25 btc in ltc and 0.25 in dgb and 0.25 in .... and 0.25 in ....\xc2\xa0'
p470
aS"Investing bitcoins in altcoins is the best thing to do as apart from that I don't have in any other investment sites who promises us to give us good profits as most of them will run away with our money in long term so better to invest in something where we can have full control on our funds."
p471
aS'I think the best place to invest at this time is ICO project and trading, just try to find out any good ICO project in Altcoin section if your choice is good enough I believe you can earn big amount of bitcoin after ICO '
p472
aS"I think you shouldn't do that. What will you do if price of all coins you invested in go down and stay for months??? Before doing anything you should do a lot of research about it. And don't invest in to much thing just focus in one or two at a time."
p473
aS"Whatever coins he have mentioned are good for making an investment and even if price goes down it will rise again and to make profits from any coins you should have great patience and if you don't have it then trading is not the right place for you."
p474
aS'One of the best way to make your BTC value more worth it is to buy alts using it. Like youve mentioned buying some alts might earn you a ticket to be an instant millionaire. Remember that the ethrium price in January is so low comapred to its price now and people who invest in etherium maybe \xc2\xa0millionaires today.Another method is think of some real world businesses because if you have some good amount of BTC you can start a pretty good business and support it.Just like today when Im typing this Crypto Are down, its a good time to buy some alts. '
p475
aS'I don\xc2\x92t\xc2\xa0 really like investment sites, my wallet is already acting as investment, lol. All I have to do is leave my bitcoin there to grow as much as possible. What I see online these days are ponziand scam $hits. So I\xc2\x92m\xc2\xa0 staying safe by not investing into anyone of them. '
p476
aS'Reality wallet is your on investment with bitcoin on it you leave it for a year and instantly it will get double or so. But if you want to have more bitcoin in short period of time you must learn how to trade and trading is not easy specially for beginners you will lose your bitcoin if you get your emotions on your way or you sell them when the price is to low which you said you need cash that would be probably a big loss\xc2\xa0 for you. '
p477
aS'0.1BTC is not really a lot of money, I think a good idea is to wait for an ico that you think it has potential and invest in it, on the other hand investing in altcoins is good idea too but the market has been very difficult in the last months since bitcoin has risen in price so rapidly, so if I were given the chance to choose one I will probably invest in an ico.'
p478
aS"0.01 capital for investing with ICO's? thats small amount and wait for months or even 2 months to get your ROI and the desired area where you can put that amount is on trading site since we can actually roll it for some good moody altcoins listed on some exchange and we can make it multiply faster if we are carefull upon trading some coins."
p479
aS'made exchange site and wait other to sell from you or paxful'
p480
aS'Not 0.01BTC but 0.1BTC, 10 times more, I think that even that is a small amount but it is way better than the amount you thought that I was stating since the fees can eat your profits very easily with that small amount of investment, especially taking into account that many are indicating that the average transaction fee is close to 0.001BTC. '
p481
aS'Try to invest it in Bittrex which is a good place to convert your Bitcoin into altcoin. You can avoid loss of money in Bittrex. Or you may just hold your wealth for a long period of time. Since its market value is increasing as time is passing by, the same with the profit that you will earn in the future. It will be hard to find an investment with low risk that will give you a high income. If the risk is high the profit will also be. So to find something that will be profitable try searching for coins with potential to avoid the risk of losing money.'
p482
aS'if you are new in investing in ICO it is good to start at small amount of capital because there are lots of ICO now are scam that is why starting at small capital is not bad at all, ofcourse small amount of capital will generate small amount of profit. And if you are true investor just invest the amount that you can afford to loose what ever happen it will never ruined your life. '
p483
aS'best invest is services site you can make site that sell digital things'
p484
aS'It is not as easy as you think and I do not think that I can bring a lot of profit you. I used to sell digital goods such as games and music but the profit was not enough for me to live. Then. I decided to give it up. Unless you know about consumer psychology, selling is never a good idea. Knowing how the customers things can give you more choice about products '
p485
aS"Selling digital things like what? For me it is possible to gaming, because in gaming you are allowed to sell items thru online. But I can't heard any news regarding that, however I was looking forward that someday encountered shop who sell gaming tools."
p486
aS'The higher the return you want the higher the risk you take. There are lots of site out there known for ponzi schemes. But if you want sure return for your investment there are also long term investments out there but I suggest to better invest it to altcoins..'
p487
aS'Nah, the best invest you can make is crowdfunding\xc2\x96 simply the best. You will be making mistakes by investing in ordinary investment sites. If these sites really mean what I think they are, then they are all Ponzi schemes; none of them is different. They use the money you invest to settle another, and the money they invest to settle you, and when they go bankrupt\xc2\x96 everything ends.'
p488
aS"Yes its better to invest in altcoin instead of falling for those ponzi schemes where you won't get anything in return and right now its very hard to find any trusted site for making an investments so if you invest in trading then you will be having full control on your funds and you can move it accordingly."
p489
aS'Agree with you mate, since many times i got scammed by ponzi/HYIP scheme i do not already trust any online investment. All i do now is investing in ICOs which giving us a possibility to get huge profit but be careful also on picking ICO because there are many ICOs are scammed they only luring more investors but they do not returned the amount that they invest.'
p490
aS'So far there are not many trustworthy places to invest in, so first you know where you want to invest, and I think as well as you are trying to invest in some ICO that can make a profit for you, but as good as you have to be careful in choosing ICO because many of them are scam, or you also try to invest into some altcoin because many coins that have the potential to be made as a place of investment.'
p491
aS'Many ICOs have turned out to be scam in the past so even investing in those is also a big risk but if you do good research about the project and the team involved in it then there is a possibility that you will find genuine ICO in which you can invest and make good money out of it.'
p492
aS"The only legit place I see to invest my bitcoins in on trading sites in different altcoins and apart from that I don't find any good place to invest my bitcoins as in the past I have lost so many times by investing in ponzi sites but now I will make sure that I don't repeat that mistake again."
p493
aS'I consider all of the investments in bitcoin have a danger every single. If you use a little investment then the small earnings you will get. If you invest with a massive amount of bitcoin then the wonderful keintunhan you will be capable to. There is no action with no risk .. for a price huge or little it all depends on the solutions of every single wallet trade. The higher the support fee the much better. Pick the appropriate your cash and reduce the dangers that exist. Probably with the mining in the hasflare you will get a minor revenue with no danger .. just depend on your cash.'
p494
aS'and You can try out do trading but you require much more knowledge ahead of ahead of commence buying and selling ,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 buying and selling its risky also but you can stop this by performing analysis before getting altcoin so you can know who coin have prospective to increase. You can earn bitcoin weekly if you do that but you require more cash in investing to receive good quantity. You dont make investments in hyip or ponzi because all of this are fraud the founder operate right after number of hrs and number of days only and your bitcoin gone if you pick that yes other men and women generate bitcoin in hyip is extremely significantly less when compared to the individuals misplaced their bitcoin simply because of this.'
p495
aS'It is true that many icos have turned into a scam but those that have not have become a huge success that is why people keep investing in them, despite the losses you may get if you fail in an investment or two that gets more than compensated when you are able to guess a coin that goes to the moon.'
p496
aS'maybe you can try trading in the market. buy some altcoin on the ongoing ICO. because the price of alcoe on Ico is cheaper. then you can sell it back when the price goes up. usually after the ICO last. otu will make you benefit from the results of altcoin ico. you can also buy another coin .. at a cheap price and then you sell at the time the price goes up. you just have to wait for a profit'
p497
aS'I agree with you since there were some scammers trying convince people with their promising words through ICO which is so sad to think because there were some ICO which is truly true and affected by those scamming scammers, they got lessen with their project because of some doubt of people that they might get scammed.'
p498
aS'I think invest site is always risk. My suggest never invest. Always remember,high risk is always high return. If you want a high risk program, there is a lot of HYIP program in the invested.'
p499
aS'sometimes more profitable to buy bitcoin through ico, but we also have to be careful, because sometimes there are some ico that even more beneficial to the holder of the project in comparison with investors who enter. we must choose carefully where we will invest.'
p500

aS"I noticed that either that some newbies are saying that - invest in gambling - as there is only one way to invest in gambling and that is thru their bankroll but the interest or profit still depends on the profit of the casino. It's a shared profit but it's a good one for long term investors. And for those newbies that saying - just invest in gambling - are treating it when they gamble, they are investing."

p505
aS'For me the best way to invest your bitcoin in on a trading site. But before you go to trading, you must study first the alt coin you gonna invest to so that you would not be lose your investment and have profit. You can also try to invest on buying ICO like on Sebeum. You can read details here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2195456.0 or https://www.sebeum.com/Sebeum_Whitepaper.pdf. '

aS'Gambling bankroll can be a good way too if you invest it in a good gambling site though still with a high risk and as long as you are not participating in the gambling itself. I do not like gambling but if someone is willing to dash me some money for bankroll profit, I see no reason why I should not take the chance. Moreover, HYIP is not even suppose to be an option as far as I am concerned for any legitimate investment.'
p507
aS"Why it is not a good idea? Have you seen those people that just waited for their profit to generate after 6 months or longer. As long as you know what casino you are entering and entrusting your bitcoins there's nothing to worry about it. There's a lot of casino's out there that are popular so it's a good investment but you don't have to focus on it because you'll just leave the job to the management."
p508
aS'You are not the only one mate. The reason why genuine ones will never come up is because most people are always after HYIP sites that will give 30% profit daily and all, which obviously increases their traffic compared to the legit ones that will probably be offering you like 0.1% - 0.3% daily. What surprises me is how people get so greedy thinking they can end up having such a high yield on their investment in such short period. You cannot even have such in real life.'

p511
aS'I guess you should try to invest your bitcoins in alts since most of atcoins have a cheap price yet it is volatile like bitcoin. However, choose those altcoins that you think is much better among the other because some of them are just shitcoin. '
p512
aS"IMO, compare casinos with exchanges isn't a good idea, casino business strategy works assuming the odds are against the player, more you play your odds worsens. Exchanges are controlled by market, so in theory odds are 50%-50%. Also, when you trade you need a solid trading plan, discipline and nerves of steel in order to execute your trading plan. No trading plan = gambling. Trading is a business, so many tools, knowledge and discipline are required."

Most people are always busy looking for unrealistic amount of profit in a short while on their investments until they end up giving out all their funds to scammers and those guys sure don\xc2\x92t take pity on greedy people of such.

p524
aS'Well! I will never suggest investing bitcoin into altcoins. That\xc2\x92s simply wastage of your bitcoin. If you have a lot of bitcoin, better keep them in wallet because holding bitcoin itself is a passive investment. Upcoming ICOs are not having potential of generating more profit than bitcoin. Bitcoin is at present the most expensive digital currency, so it does not make sense to invest them into altcoins. '

The users of the crypto currency should have the strong patience and the proper planning only then they will be able to enjoy the life with bitcoin, the importance of the bitcoin is now very popular so the holding is the best option.'
p530
aS'The only problem is that those that invest in altcoin most of the time want fast profits since they do not want to hold alts for too long, because they fear the alt is going to disappear or something, so holding alts is not as easy as holding bitcoin since you know that bitcoin is going to survive no matter what.'

It will be good to invest to really good projects ICO."
p537
aS"I think 0.1BTC is already a huge amount of money for someone who is just new in investing. For someone to post here and ask people their opinions on investment is enough information to know that the person has no idea where to put his money. In investments, I think you should start really really low. It's like testing out the water first before diving. There's just so many bad investments in the world that you have to be sure first before putting a lot of money to it. You are not forced to invest all those coins at all. You should do minimum investments at first and see what works for you.I will recommend trading and investing in ICOs but of course there are risks involved with that. In ICOs, you don't know if the developer is some greedy guy who will just run away with the company's money. In trading, you don't know if that coin will ever pump in the future or will it just inevitably die."

aS'the bitcoin itself is the safest way to invest with, but you must have high values of bitcoin. you might be scammed by all those hyip before you know you was scammed.'

aS"If your planning to invest your bitcoins in cloud minings or HYIP dont bother because that's just going to lose your money in fact dont bother investing at all just hold your Bitcoins in your online wallet provider and it will just increase in it's own. You just have to patiently wait after the next 2-5 years the price will reach new highs and your bitcoins will double or triple but if you want an quick money try trading altcoins or doing bounty campaigns but 80% of your money must be in bitcoin altcoin trading is only good for short term investment some wont last even a year."

p554
aS"That's why I don't rely with them anymore. I don't want to happen again what happened to me in the past, it's full of frustration. I get along with the flow that many are talking about cloud mining before and I get encouraged immediately without doing some research. It's my fault but right now I learned from that mistake and I'm going to focus more with my life into real trading and legit investments."
p555
aS'Yeah gambling is very risky and i do not really like to advise anyone to play on gambling websites. Trading is similar to gambling but less risk and you can do a lot of analyzation before putting your money on it so it was less risk to take before investing. I highly prefer that you invest in ethereum coin since the value is recovering quickly when it goes down and that is the safest way to invest your coin according to the speculations of different traders. '
p556
aS'Gambling is not an investment and should never be considered an investment. In fact that is like the worst advise ever! Sorry I had to just tell you that even though it is your opinion.The stakes of losing all your assets in gambling are higher than ever winning. No matter the strategies you may think you want to put into gambling, it will not work and at the end, you will be better off leaving your funds in your wallet and watch it grow in value instead.'
p557
aS'All the "success" stories about gambling just gives the newbie gamblers a motivation to put more and more bet. The leaderboards also keep these people motivated and cause them to think that they can achieve that amount of profit too. Some might even put fake scores in the leaderboards just so people would want to try and beat it.Some people are starting to consider gambling as an investment because the are basically the same thing. You put money, you risk it, and then hope for the best. But to me, gambling is nothing but a way to lose all of your money. You should consider your bet money as "gone" and consider yourself lucky if that money comes back at all. And consider yourself extremely lucky if that came back with some profits.I would advise that you just hold that bitcoins instead of gambling them. Holding bitcoin is a proven way to earn some extra bucks depending on how long and at what price you bought and sold your coins.'
p558
aS'These days, no cloud mining will even give you your ROI in 12 months and that will be like a pretty waste of time and resources. There are so much better things to do to invest one bitcoin to be able to have more and it just depends on how far each person is willing to go.So far, I still consider trading the best option but obviously, trading is not for everyone as so many people think they can just gamble their way into trading and start making huge money just like that, otherwise it is better to just hold as you have said.'
p559
aS'Bitcoin can be invested in numerous ways because you can simply exchange for local currency and invest in various options like gold, real estate, banks, initial public offering, share market and much more.But as you say, you have only 0.1 Bitcoin, so the easiest way to invest your money is crypto currency trading. But one should note that, trading in cryptocurrency is highly volatile and risky you should always trade the amount you can bear to lose. Right now, if you want to invest your money in some alt then I can suggest you the few ICO which may be beneficial if you invest your Bitcoin in them. Few of the ICO are Snip, Swarm, Hero, Eventchain, Snapup and Go Coin.'
p560
aS"Trading is the best way of investment and many are even choosing trading rather than mining. Just look on how the market of alt coins are moving and as well as the king of crypto's, bitcoin. When bitcoin is pumping, that's the right time to buy alt coins as majority of them are bleeding. And when the price of bitcoin starts to decrease, buy bitcoin and that's the selling time for alt coins."
p561
aS"The best way to invest Bitcoins is just to hodl the Bitcoin. The way the price keeps on rising on a day to day basis I think if you just hodl you will get great returns, plus it's risk free your not investing in an alt coin that has scam written all over it. Bitcoin itself is tried and tested and is still King, the rest are wannabes. "

aS'After a long go understood trading is much better even comparing to mining.To be added if u think about legit investment which u get a return with less risk factor poloniex is better.Also if you are expecting for a hight return the risk factor like website banned/scam etc is more there will be few of the ponzi or scam sites who pay high gathering the capital from investors and sharing the dividend for few days and the end holding the investors in tears.

Also, diversifying portfolios like the ones you have mentioned is pretty good and you can be lucky to see them grow hugely, just patience is all you need.'
p572
aS'Not sure if that was a mistake or you are just not sure, but it is hard fork and not hardcore. Certainly, you are right, it is best to stay clear for now and watch the situation of things a little before the fork unless you just want to take some huge risks though.Although buying at dips now, we may see some of the altcoins still pumping like some are doing now before the fork, but it is best to be very careful.'

aS"Putting money in bitcoin is already great form of investment, 0.1 is a good amount to hold and wait for long period of time before you sell it, for sure potential good income is there. But if you want to risk it just invest in trading you should but alt coin which you know that it has a possibility to increase its value in the future, and try to invest in ICO's it is much in demand earning method nowadays."
p597
aS'If you want to multiply your bitcoins and profits quickly then you can invest your bitcoins in promising upcoming ICOs as if you invest it at the right place by doing good research then you never know how higher profits you can make which can exceed from 10x to 100x or even higher depending on the demand of coins and I think this is the best way and the best place to invest your bitcoins.'
p598
aS'Ahah, and you could also become homeless\xc2\xa0 '
p599
aS"I have invested some of my bitcoins in different ICO and some of them in various altcoins where I am generating regular profits by buying low and selling high and if you don't want to take any risk of investing in bitcoins then the best thing would be to hold your bitcoins and wait for the price to pump and once it gets there start selling your coins at higher profits and buy it back when price drops and that is the safest way to make profits from bitcoins."
p600
aS"There are several options: - don't waste prices will increase ;- buy altcoin;- investing in casino game;- invest your money in some upcoming ICO"
p601
aS'if you have bitcoin you should choose a good investment like trading or follow ico project. trading you can do to buy some coins so that you mendapaykan profit in the future. while buying a coin on ico project you can buy at a cheap price then you mwnjualnya back at a high price. because coins on ico are very cheap'
p602
aS"With the high price of $11,000, bitcoin currently doesn't offer best rewards as the price needs to increase for another $11,000 to have a winning percentage of only 100%! Low priced altcoins and ICOs give you the opportunity for winning percentages of over 1000% if their value increases for small amounts compared to bitcoin."
p603
aS'I think the best way you will invest your bitcoin is to spread it to some altcoins. Buy them to a lower rates and sell it higher than its costs..'
p604
aS'With all the answer above, OP will have a wide idea now where to place his bitcoin and what are those he needed to avoid in order to be much safer,its about researching and keep on reading inside this forum for sure we will find best investment that will be fitted to our interest.'
p605
aS"I'll rephrase what you said. We had to invest to legit in websites and avoid those sites that gives daily % as they are scams. It's easy to invest in trading, if you know what you are doing. Those scams you mentioned are mostly HYIP and cloud mining, all of them are ponzi's. And those are the sites that are promising daily return, stay away from them and dont let your greediness you to be scammed."
p606
aS'Trading is not investment and buying tokens during ICO is almost like gambling, tokens can increase their value 100X but also you can lose your investment. Just holding bitcoins showed us that it actually is best kind of investment. So "mendapaykan" profit and "mwnjualnya" high can\'t be done by everyone. People do panic and lose money. People do invest in wrong projects. Damn google translator! LOL!'
p607
aS"Investing in gambling site's bankroll would be good option if you are not interested in trading or ICO. Indeed the profit might get from investing in gambling site may lower than what you may get from trading but it is easier as you will not need to spend many hours like on doing trading. Many people says it is a good investment for long term, but of course it is not a guarantee that you will make profit. Risk exists in any type of investment, so be wise in investing your bitcoin. "
p608
aS'Where to invest your bitcoin it is very big question to answer advising is free from everyone and opinions will differ from person to person at the end you are the investor and you have to decide where and when also how much. My suggestion for you if you can take less risk go with trading there is lot of site to do it. If you are safe player just hold your bitcoin. you bitcoin itself give you best return doing nothing except holding.'
p609
aS'If I have to invest my bitcoins then my first choice would be to invest in ICO and some altcoins that has good volume and can survive longer and when it comes to an investment the risk of loosing money will always be there but that risk can be minimized by doing good research and by finding the best place to invest and if it goes in your favor then you can expect good returns on your investments.'
p610
aS"First you have to decide how much risk you are going to take and how long you can wait for your investment to get good returns based on that only you can take decision where to invest your bitcoin. If you don't want to take risk better to hold your bitcoin for one year it will be double of what you have in your kitty. Other wise you go with the ICO with best analyze."
p611
aS"I believe that ICO is a good place to invest your bitcoins but only after taking proper knowledge as there are many scam projects which will disappear with your money but if you find the right one then it can bring very good returns for you and if you don't want to take risk of investing your bitcoins anywhere then the best thing would be to simply hold it for few more years and wait for the price to reach to the moon."
p612
aS' I would suggest you to hold back the bitcoin you have to get a good return in short. But still if you want to invest, inevest in the following altcoins. Bitcoincash, Dash, ETH, Zcash, Bitconnect and Monero. They are the top ones in the current market as per data shown in coinmarketcap.com. Last 7 days trend is very positive. All the best.'
p613
aS"You should invest in good altcoins that are on the top of the charts as those coins will never disappoint you in long term and will give good results on your investments but don't hold it too long and sell it as soon as you are in position of making profits and buy it back when price drops and continue the same process again and again."
p614
aS'first move your bitcoin from poloniex and use safe wallet (Hardware/offline wallet).if you know how to make 1$ \xc2\xa0 2$ \xc2\xa0 start trading. else keep holding '
p615
aS"Just look for those ICO's that are really true to their white paper and road map. Investing into some altcoins too are good so while you are holding those altcoins, investing in ICOs but also take your time too by holding most bitcoin that you have.Sometimes doing nothing with your bitcoin is the most profitable."
p616
aS'The most stable income will be just from holding your bitcoins and doing nothing '
p617
aS'Holding is better but to make profits you also need to sell your bitcoins regularly when you are getting good profits from it as only holding will never give you anything but its good to hold some and invest some to grow your bitcoins even faster and make timely profits and that can be done by investing in altcoins as it can give you profits regularly.'
p618
aS'For you to earn good profit invest in bitcoin and other altcoins. In order to maximize your earnings buy bitcoin you will sure earnings and ofcourse choose altcoin those top in coinmarketcap. '
p619
aS'Find investment site with best returns but of course with high risk. Then the other way to invest is through gambling.'
p620
aS"Casino has higher returns on long term, on short term you can have some losses, but it's very rarely to happen, depends the gamblers luck.The risk on long term is only if the casino scam everyone and run away with investors money, because the house always have profit on long term (that is shared with investors)."
p621
aS'Lets now put our feet back on the ground. Think of this. Whos stupid enough to spend such a smallamount and consider it an investment? Its a joke. Its better to gamble with the 0.1 BTC and hope to get lucky.'
p622
aS'You can try investing in gambling site but im not sure if how much you can earn. Nowadays investing in altcoins is more profitable and less risk compared to other ways.'
p623
aS"In reality no one place are riskless to make profit and better return without risk .By chance you can get return in Ponzi sites but can't get Everytime return .I will suggest you to start trading also with your bitcoin Because trading is also like the lending in the Poloniex , if you will understand and will do trading wisely then surely you will get earning without\xc2\xa0 risk , Because without trading ( day trading + altcoins trading) you can't go for big earning ."
p624
aS"0 1 btc is a good amount to start but keep in mind that if you want to earn you should take risk. Trading is the best way for me but like other said it's very risky but if you think you can take the risk.then go for it"
p625
aS'Yeah its worth to take risk in trading and that risk can be reduced if you learn the entire process of trading and then enter into it and even if you make loss at initial stage you should not worry as it will give you good learning experience.'
p626
aS"That is not so rare, i have seen my funds many times on negative profit after investing into cryptocurrency casino, but you are right about the first part- it mostly was on short term.Poloniex has pretty decent return of lending rates, you can make up a good profit with enough funds, but you shouldn't compare it to investing into casino bankroll.Lending business is something where you can be sure that the profit is going to be made, and with investing into bankroll of gambling website you cannot know, if it will bring profits from you, or the site will lose ( and you too).The second option is mostly about how many players are in there, because if you can see many players doing bets, then you will probably get a really nice gains on long term."
p627
aS'Select top 10 altcoins and diversify your investment in those coins and keep a watch on price movements and even if 1 or 2 coins pumps up then it will give you the best profits as of now I think that is the only best place to invest your bitcoins.'
p628
aS'I think investing in top 10 altcoin wont do anything,invest only in top 3 and mainly ethereum .it will increase more and more due to plenty of project that are being made on ethereum blockchain.'
p629
aS'Mining in eobot, has lowest risk but low rates of profit. However it is still profitable'
p630
aS'My personality, if I get 0.1 BTC I want choosing 5 top altcoin. We can trade 0.02 btc /coins. I suggest to choose exchanger which have big volume like Poloniex or Bittrex exchange. We are know that there are having very good coins and have big volume too. '
p631
aS'Ok then in what altcoin would you recommend that he invest his 0.1 BTC in? Why do you think its good and tell us if you invested in it yourself.We also want to know what altcoins you were trading that have given you profit and what have given you losses.'
p632
aS'Try mate to invest in newagebank it will give deoble of your investment in a month. Also good to invest in trading if you are good enough on this method.And much better to avoid gambling in your list of investment because this is not profitable anymore.'
p633
aS'Just save your bitcoin in your wallet and wait for the right time to sell your bitcoin because value are continuous increasing and you will gain better profit on that.And if you want to boost your earning just try to trade some of your bitcoin in altcoin but just be careful in doing that method its very hard to find great coins to trade.'
p634
aS'Holding bitcoin is a traditional way of earning profit but i agree still many people around the forum doing that. If you have enough holding in your wallet just invest it on trading. You can make profit instantly due to price change in the chart. However please be careful about scammers.'
p635
aS"Yeah an I just want to emphasize, if you want a low risk investment. Then trading isn't for you. We all know that trading involve high risk because there are lots of things you should consider before engaging in trading. It will give you a decent profit or even huge if you made the right decision. BUT, the counterpart might occur if you made the wrong decision. Trading requires such skill in decision making, having a research and staying away from those scam coins scattered from different trading platforms."
p636
aS"Wow dude, every people have their own opinion. 0.1 is small for you but for some people 0.1 is really big and you can invest any amount, even 0.01 too.For OP, you can invest on gambling sites like dice site. They have a good interest for every week. If you wont invest on dice sites. You can just hold your bitcoin and wait until the price of bitcoin increase. It's like invest too."
p637
aS"Okay, too much thread like this right now.1. Invest on stable altcoins or reputable ICOs now. New projects with great idea is incoming and you have a chance to take a part on these great idea.2. Invest on casino's bankroll and see your progress based of player's luck and bet.3. Lending on Poloniex, although it gives you small profit but it's more better than invest on HYIP."
p638
aS'Tell me how 0.1 BTC is big. In any country I can say that from an investment standpoint at the current rates 0.1 BTC is not big enough to be called a REAL investment. Maybe if youre a 14 year old, you can. How old are you by the way?'
p639
aS'Invest in casino more surely profitable then hyip. Ofcourse you cab lost too but it only a small percentage.'

aS"Partially true..If you have some good TLDs regarding BTC/Alt-coins, you should have no problem getting good BTC for them. Post a thread in the Marketplace section and see if you get any offers. If there's no interest, then that should be a good indicator of their resale value. "
p4
aS'As you can see in his first lines... The threads talking about domain sales all died....'
p5
aS'EDIT: <temper temper>The way I see this is that the VCurrency market is about to explode. We have new reports every day of people and organisations (large ones) adopting BTC as a realistic currency to trade in. Governments are starting to take the thing seriously, albeit because they want tax out of it.Good TLDs will be a big part of this because these days when someone wants to buy or sell something, the first medium that enters their head is the internet.So for now, I\'ll have a little think about the domains I own, and whether or not to sell them. But if you are under the impression that $50 is a "normal" price for a good domain, then I\'m happy to bet against you  Specially since I already own the chips, in a manner of speaking.Thank you all for replies though, and I hope to be able to post some nice names for sale soon.Rit.'

p12
aS'If your "premium" domain is CryptoExploreCoin.org or Bit-Mining-Sell-Cheap.net, it is not worth 50 BTC.'
p13

p5
aS'Hi, thanks for your feedback, we highly value hearing from a different perspective here. You mentioned that you can buy Amazon cards for 10% or more off face value with BTC. Could you please provide the method with which to do so? This would be very helpful for us to know. We have seen a few BTC to Amazon services but none with 10%+ off. Thanks!'
p6
aS"Sure, check out gc4btc.com (Announce Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331579.0 ), he actually sells Amazon cards for 20% off face value on the website and 15% of face value if you place an order with him via PM or e-mail. \xc2\xa0As you can see from the thread, he has been around for a long time and has always delivered without any problems that couldn't immediately be resolved. \xc2\xa0Buying cards from the website can be troublesome, because a lot of us Amazon GC buyers have scripts running that notify us when new GCs are listed, giving us an opportunity to buy them more regularly than someone who might just check the website every now-and-then (this is why he offers a 15% discount for orders).This is only one example of the many users here that frequently sell Amazon Gift Cards at 10%+ off face value. \xc2\xa0If you check around the Digital Goods and Services sections you're sure to find a handful of other reputable dealers.Using these gift cards, you might actually be able to offer people a 5-10% discount over the Woot.com price! \xc2\xa0Which would, in my opinion, be a much more useful service.Good luck with your business!"
p7
aS'Thank you for the info. It looks like the biggest issue with going the gift card route is that they are scarce and usually out of stock, especially since Woot.com deals are time sensitive so if you want to take advantage of a deal, there is a good chance that you won\'t be able to buy one of the gift cards in time. But we will keep your recommendations in mind with regards to how we can improve our services. And with that said, we do want to do more orders through Woot.com and sites like it, so with that in mind we\'ve knocked our "tip" down to just 5% for Woot.com so that we can do more orders '

Then we split the left over proceeds 50/50.- Why don't I do it myself? I'm new here and would not be trusted. My idea and how will we handle the raffle will blow people away with the high win rates and high win amounts. We will even have a monthly HUGE raffle of all the non-winners.- Why do this since there are already raffle and gambling sites? If you have ever programmed or gambled on these sites you know your odds to win against these scripts/sites are near impossible. Why are casinos so big? Not because they pay the morons they bring in.- Why would someone want to do a forum based Raffle? My Raffles will only accept 100 people and 3 people will win per round and all non winners are in the HUGE monthly drawing.So maybe it's a bad idea, but I personally think it will be a good idea that beats playing against rigged software, gambling sites and very cheap to play for such big winnings and good odds.All I need is a trusted forum member that has dealt will trading and would like to be my partner. You will do nothing more that receive the coin and pay it out. I will do everything else, even type the post for you.We will get on skype or the phone and discuss and plan.Let me know what you think and PM me if you are interested."

Some of us sold cars, collectibles, jewellery and inheritances to ride the Bitcoin train, but this man is selling everything, yes, EVERYTHING he owns for Bitcoin.Here\'s what he\'s got "Cabin in norway 30 min from stavanger and everything i own":Hi im going to sell my cabin and almost everything I own.Is a nice property in the woods 5 min drive to a store for shopping.30min from stavanger sentrum with car or boat.The property is 2000m2 with a main cabin 40m2 and annex 15m2 and 2 smaller sheds 7 and 5m2.The cabin are livable all year around, has rain water for shower and sinks, fireplace and a heat pump for heating. Electric burning toilet.. You can probably build a house there in a couple off years.My car is a opel astra 2001 model fully functional.Want to sell my tv, active speakers, tools for gardening, tools for handiwork, even my clothes if you so wishes to ..I will come with pictures maybe a movie on youtube so its possible to see the property.Selling everything for around 530btc or highest biddercontact if interested norwegia......@gmail.comIs he doing it right? Is he even doing it? In a Bitcoin market everything it skeptic-able , yet everything is possible.'

Same goes to those who dedicated tens of thousands of dollars towards the ASIC projects when they where still on pen and paper. They were definitely worth the gamble."

S"Hi,I think that the Digital Goods (abbreviated to D.G.) section is cramped with domain selling, which fairly it's part of the digital goods. However, I think that there are a lot of people selling domains, showing that there is a high supply of domains in this forum and people that are in the D.G. section who wants to find e.g. gift cards, game codes... hard to find their desired threads.Also in the auction, I think the section should separate computer hardware to digital goods (or just domains if possible).I think that this will benefit the community and make this section clearer overall.Do vote on the thread as this can help the admins to see the public opinion on this forum.Thanks for reading (sorry for my english)"

aS'Hi! Quick update on the leaderboards and the 1.2 BTC prize:- PUB05fad62f6a17 is on track to win 0.6 BTC for leading the "High Roller", "King Midas", and "Someone has to Win" categories.- PUB44b7ad187c46 is leading the "Grind it out" category and will win 0.2 BTC unless someone stops him.- PUB33ea5ec6f8e6 "Cant\' catch a break" and will win 0.2 BTC unless someone else proves as unlucky.The big opportuninty, though, is the "Get rich while you sleep" category.\xc2\xa0 Currently getting just one referral would put you at the top of that leaderboard for 0.2 BTC.Thanks!MooCoinadmin@moocoin.com'
p2
aS"I like your site.\xc2\xa0 ONe thing is I don't think there needs to be so much time for each player to make a move.\xc2\xa0 Second, if I create a game, sometimes I have another window open while I'm waiting for someone to play and the game starts when I'm not looking, and I lose."
p3
aS'If you have your volume up, the site will "moo" at you when your game starts\xc2\xa0 '
p4
aS'I like the site a lot! Hope it gets more active soon!'
p5
aS"Thanks!\xc2\xa0 Traffic is going to make or break the site.\xc2\xa0 Signatures like your help, so thank you!I'm trying to avoid making one-player games, but if traffic doesn't catch up, we may need to do that so people always have something to play..."
p6
aS"how do we get referrals? I assume there's a link I can send to friends or something..."
p7
aS"Yep!\xc2\xa0 There's a referral link at the bottom of the site that gives you instructions.Thanks!MooCoin"
p8
aS"Ditto. \xc2\xa0It's a good question considering an account (url) was created for us as soon as we arrived on the page, and there are no links or mentions of affiliate or referrals that I can see.-edit - now i see it.\xc2\xa0 Just a suggestion, you may want to reconsider that white text on mostly white footer idea."
p9
aS'Nice site!\xc2\xa0 I look forward to playing and losing lots of games. '
p10
aS'Good call.There are actually 3 themes on the site, depending what time it is in your local area.\xc2\xa0 You may have seen it change if you were on the site at 5:00pm, 7:00pm, or 7:00am.\xc2\xa0 The "sunset" theme at 5pm was hard to read.Now it\'s fixed\xc2\xa0 We also added a "How do I refer people?" link next to the referral leaderboard.Thanks for the suggestions!MooCoin'
p11
aS'Hi Everyone,Do you think this is a cool concept, but wish there were more people on the site?\xc2\xa0 Help us out by upvoting our reddit link, or creating your own.Also, remember you have a referral code that you can see by scrolling to the bottom of the MooCoin site!http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1v73av/new_bitcoin_gaming_platform_create_your_own_games/Thanks!MooCoin'
p12
aS'Liking your idea and having fun with it but wish there was more than 2 games and more than just 1 on 1 play.'
p13
aS"Thanks!\xc2\xa0 One of the cool things about MooCoin is that it's an open gaming platform.\xc2\xa0 We have an API that lets other developers create games to be hosted within our website.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the two games we already have are built on our own APIs.\xc2\xa0 We're hoping that we can get some players on board, which will then lead to talented developers creating more games for the site.\xc2\xa0 We're also working on our third game for the site, internally.Regarding one player games, we're starting to consider that, as well.\xc2\xa0 Especially when there isn't high traffic, being able to come anytime and play against the computer.\xc2\xa0 We're already brainstorming some fun games in case we move this direction.Thanks!MooCoin"
p14
aS'You\'re welcome. Yeah I\'m a computer guy and currently studying to get some certs but I\'m studying more for inter security and networking instead of coding and developing, otherwise I\'d be very much into coding a game for you guys especially since your post says that the developer would get a little upfront fee and a small amount of profits that, that, game brings to the site. Anyone who knows about money there is no greater kind than that which is continual income. Speaking of income I\'ve been looking and even though I\'ve been in the forums for a day checking here and there I have noticed that plenty of companies mainly gambling companies are paying fees to have people "pimp" out their sigs for them either straight monthly fee or by number of posts a month; is this something you guys are currently doing or plan on doing eventually?'
p15
aS"Not sure.\xc2\xa0 Of course we would love people to use our referral program to bring people to the site.\xc2\xa0 Signatures play a big part in that.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully our existing referral incentives will lead to folks putting us in their signatures.\xc2\xa0 If not, we have a couple of other options we're considering.\xc2\xa0 I personally feel like organic growth is best.\xc2\xa0 We're not in this to get a bunch of people to the site so we can get people to play against house odds.\xc2\xa0 We're trying to create something awesome:\xc2\xa0 An open gaming platform where developers can create cool, unique games in a simple and secure way.\xc2\xa0 And a place where players can come and battle it out for fun through faucet play, or for profit through deposits.I guess the end goal either way is a bunch of users\xc2\xa0 Thanks,MooCoin"

p17
aS'Curious about the referrals... I plan to write a couple articles about your site on my crypto blog and maybe make a video for you... hoping those pay off for you AND me (of course!) with lots of sign-ups.\xc2\xa0 But I also wanted to check on something.\xc2\xa0 I referred my roommate, but I didn\'t get credit for a sign-up.\xc2\xa0 I will make the assumption that it\'s because it\'s showing up that the sign-up came from the same IP address -- but I figured I would check to be sure.\xc2\xa0 And even though my referral was legitimate, if you aren\'t blocking or guarding against multiple accounts from a single IP, you may want to consider implementing such a system so someone doesn\'t cheat the system.\xc2\xa0 I\'d hate to send 50+ referrals your way and lose out to some schmuck who "refers" several hundred virtual machines or sandboxed browsers to steal your generous .2BTC offer.P.S. You\'re welcome for the user interface tip.\xc2\xa0 '
p18
aS"Sorry I didn't make the referral system super clear.\xc2\xa0 Here's how it works:When you refer someone, you get 10% of all fees we collect from that user, for life.\xc2\xa0 The 10% is instantly credited to your own MooCoin account in realtime.We collect a 1% fee from the winner of any wager over .0001 btc.\xc2\xa0 The leaderboard reflects the total amount you've earned from our referral system.\xc2\xa0 If you refer one person who wins a single wager of 1000 btc, you'll have earned, and are going to show up on the leaderboard with 1 btc.This essentially eliminates people gaming the system by referring a bunch of bogus accounts.\xc2\xa0 Both for the tournament, and post-launch.Hope that helps!MooCoin"
p19
aS"Ok what about if a user that I referred bets .00000100 BTC 10 times, will I get .00000001 BTC in referrals?\xc2\xa0 Otherwise it's going to be impossible for the tournament to get referral BTC."
p20
aS"No, we don't charge any fees at all for wagers below .0001 btc.\xc2\xa0 We want people to play micro-limits for fun, and for free.It's pretty easy to play bigger games on the site.\xc2\xa0 I'm actually a bit surprised we don't have anyone winning 20 btc games, yet.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps not everyone understands TestNet.If you want more coins, there are a number of TestNet faucets that give out free TestNet btc.\xc2\xa0 Go check out http://faucet.xeno-genesis.com/ orhttp://tpfaucet.appspot.com/Thanks,MooCoin"
p21
aS"I can't believe you are going to give out .4 to someone who is basically scamming the site.\xc2\xa0 There's someone who has played 95 games, and lost all 95.\xc2\xa0 So it's basically who has the most time to kill.\xc2\xa0 He's just joining games and losing on purpose, I've seen him do it to me. (betting low with a 2)."
p22
aS'Some of this behavior is "abnormal" and unique to the beta.\xc2\xa0 You won\'t see people intentionally losing games after launch.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we created an incentive so that we could see it now.\xc2\xa0 Maybe we should explain more about the process we\'ve learned over the years to develop software and create startups.We have a backlog of Leap of Faith assumptions.\xc2\xa0 We rank order those assumptions based on risk to the success of the project.\xc2\xa0 We then test those as quickly and cheaply as possible.\xc2\xa0 There\'s much more to it than that, but if you want a good overview of the process we use, it\'s very similar to the "Lean Startup" by Eric Ries.In that context, our first question was, "Could someone drain the faucet?" because that posed a risk to the concept of the site.\xc2\xa0 We ran a beta on MainNet with a faucet a month ago and found that people were able to exploit the faucet.\xc2\xa0 One person was so successful that they drained $10 USD out of the faucet before they hit the hard limit per user we set in the system.\xc2\xa0 We kept the beta open and tweaked the faucet until we were confident that we had systems in place to limit exploitation.\xc2\xa0 That led to better ways to monitor the velocity of the faucet, and better backup plans we can implement in case someone finds an exploit.That\'s just one experiment, and we have hundreds in the backlog.The tournament is not in place because we want to give people money\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 It\'s there to answer very specific questions we have.\xc2\xa0 Take the win:loss, winning streak, and losing streak categories for example.\xc2\xa0 We want to put a system in place that flags abnormal behavior outside of a "normal" threshold.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t know where to set the threshold without real people on the website.\xc2\xa0 We want some of them to act "normally" and others to act "abnormally" so we can build out a distribution.\xc2\xa0 Hence, the leaderboads that incent "good" behavior and "bad" behavior.\xc2\xa0 The data we\'re collecting about player behavior will be used to make the site better, flag cheaters in the future, and work out any bugs before our launch.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve already built out some models of regular user behavior, uncovered a bug related to network communication problems that makes games get "stuck", and made changes to the site based on this tournament.Everything we\'ve learned is what we wanted to learn, and we\'re getting all of it for roughly $1,200 USD.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\'s what one of our Software Engineers makes in a few hours at his day job.We\'re actually really happy to share this transparent way we think about the problem with folks - we just normally don\'t find people that interested in hearing about it.\xc2\xa0 If anyone has questions about how we code, how we think about the structure of the platform, or what our goals are with MooCoin, let us know!\xc2\xa0 We\'re doing something that we think is really special by creating a place where developers can create cool games and people can play them.\xc2\xa0 We could have created YADG (Yet Another Dice Game), but we aspire to make something better than that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re still in the early stages, so stay with us.\xc2\xa0 I promise it will be a lot of fun!Thanks,MooCoin'
p23
aS'Wow that makes sense.\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t mind paying people who are "scamming" right now so long as they help you figure out how to avoid behavior like that in the future.\xc2\xa0 Ok, well on that front I\'m not even going to bother trying to win any of the categories, but I wish you the best of luck.'
p24
aS'^^ Dude chill it isn\'t your baby.\xc2\xa0 Live fire fragging is some of the best testing. I got in on that faucet before, after that told them and helped to fix it. If it\'s possible to exploit, someone will inevitably. So stop crying you didn\'t have the "good" idea. Like the guy who camps in a FPS gets a 2.0 k/d, don\'t be mad he owned you, the game can be played many ways.In transaction history when you withdraw it comes up as undefined. Everything else seems to be working fine as of now. Good job. '
p25
aS'How do faucets really work? Are they actual "capital" coins or is like monopoly money. It might look nice to have 500 but no store will ever break the $500 for a candy bar much less let you buy the candy bar?'
p26
aS'Faucets are just a place to get coins for free.The "monopoly money" aspect of MooCoin is that we\'re currently running on TestNet.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a parallel network that we use for testing so we don\'t put real bitcoins at risk.\xc2\xa0 Once we\'ve proven out the software, we\'ll switch to the main network.Thanks!MooCoin'
p27
aS"Hope you're starting to see some of that volume move up, hopefully see this in the future as well.\xc2\xa0 Surprising enough it adds up quick that little fee. If people start bringing in their own coin this could be another primo thing."

aS"We just introduced a new feature.\xc2\xa0 We now have a friendly bot on the site that will play games with you.\xc2\xa0 We decided to do this to make sure that you always had someone to play, even when traffic is low.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure you know you're playing a bot, so we've tagged him:He will always keep one hi-lo game open at .000001 btc.\xc2\xa0 If you don't see him, it's because he's already in a game.\xc2\xa0 Just give him a second and he'll create another one as soon as he's finished.\xc2\xa0 Also, he's not very good.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he's horrible.\xc2\xa0 It's just a proof of concept right now.\xc2\xa0 What do you guys think?\xc2\xa0 Should we have bots on the site to play when there aren't enough people?\xc2\xa0 If you like the idea, we'll make it provably fair, etc.Thanks,MooCoin"
p33
aS"Hey everyone,Please don't bot the bot.\xc2\xa0 In other words, don't join the bots game with your scripts.\xc2\xa0 I'd like it to hang out there for people when they show up to play, rather than having them leave the site because there aren't any games.\xc2\xa0 Having games for people to play when they come to the site is critical for our success.\xc2\xa0 Thanks,MooCoin"
p34
aS'I am pretty sure all the cheating will only scare away potential users. Some tournament this is.....'
p35
aS'We\'re allowing "cheating" right now during beta so we can measure it, and build models that will help us eliminate it when the site goes live. Once we go live, well disallow cheating. Thanks! MooCoin'
p36
aS"I'm not complaining but some people took this to a new level. I was pulling decent leads on everyone in 4 categories. Then you got the guy who apparently has a little to much free time doing 1300 BTC between 2 accounts. This just made it less fun as the 20 testnet coins I have been waiting to deposit for 3 days finally arrived. That pace isn't even worth catching up to, but challenge accepted as I'm not inclined to just let another win. If I come out of this with nothing I'm gunna freak a little.On a side note we drained over 1000 coins in under a week and i'm pretty sure it's lagging like a bitch as some deposits are not even showing."
p37
aS'2 things you might want to think about adding is how much the current wager is for and if your opponent is a bot in the game. Seeing the outcome of the game for a few seconds would be nice before it flashes the congrats or sorry message as well.'
p38
aS"Deposits can take some time on TestNet.\xc2\xa0 The block mining is a little less stable and predictable compared to mainNet.The people who are using huge amounts and huge numbers of games are really stress testing the system.\xc2\xa0 I know it's frustrating from a player point-of-view, but it's all in the name of making the site rock-solid for when we go live on MainNetThanks,MooCoin"

(betting low with a 2)."
p45
aS'Some of this behavior is "abnormal" and unique to the beta.\xc2\xa0 You won\'t see people intentionally losing games after launch.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we created an incentive so that we could see it now.\xc2\xa0 Maybe we should explain more about the process we\'ve learned over the years to develop software and create startups.We have a backlog of Leap of Faith assumptions.\xc2\xa0 We rank order those assumptions based on risk to the success of the project.\xc2\xa0 We then test those as quickly and cheaply as possible.\xc2\xa0 There\'s much more to it than that, but if you want a good overview of the process we use, it\'s very similar to the "Lean Startup" by Eric Ries.In that context, our first question was, "Could someone drain the faucet?" because that posed a risk to the concept of the site.\xc2\xa0 We ran a beta on MainNet with a faucet a month ago and found that people were able to exploit the faucet.\xc2\xa0 One person was so successful that they drained $10 USD out of the faucet before they hit the hard limit per user we set in the system.\xc2\xa0 We kept the beta open and tweaked the faucet until we were confident that we had systems in place to limit exploitation.\xc2\xa0 That led to better ways to monitor the velocity of the faucet, and better backup plans we can implement in case someone finds an exploit.That\'s just one experiment, and we have hundreds in the backlog.The tournament is not in place because we want to give people money\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 It\'s there to answer very specific questions we have.\xc2\xa0 Take the win:loss, winning streak, and losing streak categories for example.\xc2\xa0 We want to put a system in place that flags abnormal behavior outside of a "normal" threshold.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t know where to set the threshold without real people on the website.\xc2\xa0 We want some of them to act "normally" and others to act "abnormally" so we can build out a distribution.\xc2\xa0 Hence, the leaderboads that incent "good" behavior and "bad" behavior.\xc2\xa0 The data we\'re collecting about player behavior will be used to make the site better, flag cheaters in the future, and work out any bugs before our launch.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve already built out some models of regular user behavior, uncovered a bug related to network communication problems that makes games get "stuck", and made changes to the site based on this tournament.Everything we\'ve learned is what we wanted to learn, and we\'re getting all of it for roughly $1,200 USD.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\'s what one of our Software Engineers makes in a few hours at his day job.We\'re actually really happy to share this transparent way we think about the problem with folks - we just normally don\'t find people that interested in hearing about it.\xc2\xa0 If anyone has questions about how we code, how we think about the structure of the platform, or what our goals are with MooCoin, let us know!\xc2\xa0 We\'re doing something that we think is really special by creating a place where developers can create cool games and people can play them.\xc2\xa0 We could have created YADG (Yet Another Dice Game), but we aspire to make something better than that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re still in the early stages, so stay with us.\xc2\xa0 I promise it will be a lot of fun!Thanks,MooCoin'
p46
aS'Wow that makes sense.\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t mind paying people who are "scamming" right now so long as they help you figure out how to avoid behavior like that in the future.\xc2\xa0 Ok, well on that front I\'m not even going to bother trying to win any of the categories, but I wish you the best of luck.'
p47
aS'^^ Dude chill it isn\'t your baby.\xc2\xa0 Live fire fragging is some of the best testing. I got in on that faucet before, after that told them and helped to fix it. If it\'s possible to exploit, someone will inevitably. So stop crying you didn\'t have the "good" idea. Like the guy who camps in a FPS gets a 2.0 k/d, don\'t be mad he owned you, the game can be played many ways.In transaction history when you withdraw it comes up as undefined. Everything else seems to be working fine as of now. Good job. '
p48
aS'How do faucets really work? Are they actual "capital" coins or is like monopoly money. It might look nice to have 500 but no store will ever break the $500 for a candy bar much less let you buy the candy bar?'
p49
aS'Faucets are just a place to get coins for free.The "monopoly money" aspect of MooCoin is that we\'re currently running on TestNet.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a parallel network that we use for testing so we don\'t put real bitcoins at risk.\xc2\xa0 Once we\'ve proven out the software, we\'ll switch to the main network.Thanks!MooCoin'

p56
aS"Hey everyone,Please don't bot the bot.\xc2\xa0 In other words, don't join the bots game with your scripts.\xc2\xa0 I'd like it to hang out there for people when they show up to play, rather than having them leave the site because there aren't any games.\xc2\xa0 Having games for people to play when they come to the site is critical for our success.\xc2\xa0 Thanks,MooCoin"

p59
aS"I'm not complaining but some people took this to a new level. I was pulling decent leads on everyone in 4 categories. Then you got the guy who apparently has a little to much free time doing 1300 BTC between 2 accounts. This just made it less fun as the 20 testnet coins I have been waiting to deposit for 3 days finally arrived. That pace isn't even worth catching up to, but challenge accepted as I'm not inclined to just let another win. If I come out of this with nothing I'm gunna freak a little.On a side note we drained over 1000 coins in under a week and i'm pretty sure it's lagging like a bitch as some deposits are not even showing."
p60
aS'2 things you might want to think about adding is how much the current wager is for and if your opponent is a bot in the game. Seeing the outcome of the game for a few seconds would be nice before it flashes the congrats or sorry message as well.'
p61
aS"Deposits can take some time on TestNet.\xc2\xa0 The block mining is a little less stable and predictable compared to mainNet.The people who are using huge amounts and huge numbers of games are really stress testing the system.\xc2\xa0 I know it's frustrating from a player point-of-view, but it's all in the name of making the site rock-solid for when we go live on MainNetThanks,MooCoin"

S"Hi bitcoiners. As some of you know I started a bitcoin escrow service one month ago in order to protect both buyer and seller into a bitcoin transaction.We provide mediation services as long as supporting donation escrow based for people which requested it.You can get or request more informations at btcrow.com or at the official thread here: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=21544.0So, what's that new specials on you site ?In fact we charge in normal case 1% for donation base escrow and 2% for mediation based escrow. We are then reducing our prices till the end of july to only 0.01btc fees for any escrow price. But why we are doing that ?In fact I started this escrow not just to make profit but because I strongly think that bitcoins will succeed and I wanna be part of it. The reason why this reduction occurs is because after pushing a little our escrow service and sometimes other escrow service, there's still plenty of people getting scammed because they simply not know what an escrow is or wasn't aware that such service existed for bitcoins.So to be fair and that people learn using our services we only charge 0.01btc per transaction. This mean we won't do profit till in normal case each transaction we process include a 0.01 transaction fee goes to the miner for speeding up process.ok:you are still reading ?you was about to do a bitcoin transaction before the end of July ?you feel that our services can help you processing safer transaction ?If you answered yes to all of theses questions then you're ready for the first coupon code:NOSCAMJULY Enter this coupon at http://btcrow.com to have a fixed escrow fee of 0.01btc only for any of your bitcoin transaction with us.P.S: I would like that while reading this you complete the poll, it is very important to know if I should start advertising campaign or not in order to show that a way of protecting your bitcoins in a transaction is possible.Happy transactionsJules"

S'With the mybitcoin.com problem burning across the horizon a common comment is "you shouldn\'t trust your wallet to an online service" which is a fine idea if you never want to use your wallet except on your personal computer. However we live in a world with multiple computers, mobile devices and of course there is the merchant side of things to deal with. If we raise the barrier of entry for merchants to accept bitcoins then we lower the viability of bitcoins.\xc2\xa0 So there are two sides to this problem.1) How do we make bitcoins more usable by the consumer (get them off our laptops/PCs and into our daily lives) 2) How do we lower the barrier of entry and increase the trust for merchants.Online services (like mybitcoin.com was) seemed to promise to be the answer to that.. But obviously with its going down multiple times (and maybe/ maybe not coming back).. They have failed.So lets start an open dialog about what a "good service" would need to do to become trusted, and what features it would need to provide. I think everyone should have a voice here and would love to hear from all the various parties, Miners, Consumers, Merchants, etc.. if you are involved in using bitcoins write up your service wishlist and post it.I\'m not sure where this conversation will take us, other than allowing those entities that might be interested in making a good wallet service to know where the bar is, and god forbid, make a service we could both trust and be willing to use..

All in all, that site screams "SCAM" all over the place, but on the other hand there seems to be a real person / company behind it. It would be very easy for flexcoin to build up some trust if only they would reveal a few more details about themselves, and yet, they don\'t. Really, i don\'t know, but for the moment, i\'d stay away.Feel free to add to this list.'

aS'I noticed one of your key comments on all of these was that you didn\'t feel comfortable with them.. So lets start there.. what would a Wallet/merchant service provider need to do to build trust with its users..\xc2\xa0 What are the key features, that if you saw them (and could verify them) you would say "ok thats a wallet I can get behind"...~Josh'
p3
aS"I actually am perfectly happy with instawallet.org as it is. But, instawallet is just that: an instant wallet service for tiny amounts. Just like carrying your cash around in the pocket of your trousers.For a full-blown online wallet service, i personally would require the following:full name and (company) address of the people behind it, confirmed by some kind of authoritylocated in a country where i know i could potentially successfully sue them (btw, that's why i included the countries in my listing)some financial backing, for example an Ltd. with an original capital of somewhere around 25.000 EURinsurance for my deposit, covering loss due to criminal offence, technical problems, you-name-itgeneral insight into their security measures (not too much details, but things like distribution of servers, backups, etc.)"
p4
aS'All this talk of a central authority brings up some of the reasons why people prefer bitcoin to fiat currencies in the first place.I think The phone applications are a much better route then the online service. As long as I can pay/receive money from my phone there is no need for instawallet, mybitcoin or any of them.It is also a step towards another important goal for more wide-spread adoption, being able to use them in physical stores.'
p5
aS'For those users who wish to stay anonymous, online wallets will probably never be an ideal solution. Sooner or later, online wallet services will face legal requirements to have at least some kind of "traceability" regarding their users.I don\'t actually see that as a problem, there will always be a tradeoff between security and anonymity. Those of us fortunate enough to be able to reveal their identity will have slightly better protection from evildoers. Those of us fortunate enough to stay completely anonymous will probably never be able to sue somebody who ran with their bitcoins. Some of us might want both, a secure, covered-by-insurance bitcoin "bank" account, as well as a wallet of dirty money \xc2\xa0Agreed, they are a good alternative for some of the cash purposes of online wallets. They are not an alternative to merchant or banking services, which online wallets may or may not offer.Being able to accept bitcoins without the need to install any hard- or software at all is a major step towards wide-spread adoption, and online wallets offer just that.Don\'t get me wrong here, i do not advertise online wallets as the solution for everything, and i won\'t encourage anyone to use any of the momentarily existing online wallet services for anything but petty cash, but i am absolutely certain that online wallets will be the main means of using bitcoins for the average Joe in the near future, like it or not.'

You said you discontinued the project because you lacked time, I hope not because it wasn't profitable. I just want to cover any expenses, if I also get a few bitcoins per week I don't mind.PS I know I sound very strange, but I did the mistake of bidding first and asking later.

Apologies if anyone considers this unfair, but the amount of time and effort I've put into development I think justifies this!"

Currently I am running at 925-975 MHz (the individual cores vary) at 1.1625V, temps 58-68C.One thing to watch out for is that when attempting to overclock the cores and tune them you may lock them up, requiring a reboot.

As Bitcoin grows it will become more obvious that the Bitcoin wiki is not really the best place for this. \xc2\xa0For one, a wiki is not the best tool (see #2) and the freelancer listings really don't fit here. \xc2\xa0 So that freelancers needn't wait any longer, perhaps this less-than-optimal solution will serve just fine for a while until a better service is available?2.) Tagging service categories is awkward. \xc2\xa0More granularity could be added using subcategories, but again, a wiki project isn't the best tool for this. \xc2\xa0I added one such subcategory, Technical Support, to show how subcategories might be used for this.3.) Fully editable pages -- depends on honor system to prevent vandalism, misinformation.Incidentally, here's the list of users on that wiki now:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Special:ListUsersIs using the Bitcoin wiki in this manner acceptable? \xc2\xa0Or are there any other thoughts on this?[Edited]"

S'Hello everyoneWe\'re a very small team of self-improvement book authors, and we\'re curious about Bitcoin as a way to sell e-books. For some of the subjects we write about, we believe customers would enjoy the anonymity. But we\'re not sure there is enough of a market to build a whole website yet.That\'s why we\'re launching an experiment. Our dating and seduction author, Alejandro, is writing a new edition of his "Guide to women, relationships and sex", exclusively for the Bitcoin market. You can find 8 pages from the guide here: http://www.bitcoinservice.co.uk/files/83 for the symbolic price of 0.1 BTC. We will use the number of downloads as an indication of the size of the market. If we reach more than 50 downloads, the full book will be published. If we reach more than 100 downloads, we will create a dedicated website and expand our book catalog.Please note that we\'ll never ask for customer info, and that our books will never have any kind of DRM.Of course, even if you don\'t want to pay for the excerpt, feel free to voice your opinion and/or offer suggestions. Would there be some topics of self-improvement you\'d like to see in book form ?SelfHelp Authors, in search of a bitcoin-related new name'
p1
aS"The bitcoin market's size is dependent on the number of goods and services. You temporary expanded the market with 8 pages, but without other books, the market won't expand to support your preferred download counts, and hence revenue.If you think bitcoin is likely to be widely successfully in the future, then it make sense to sell at least one book for bitcoin.If you, on the other hand, think bitcoin will eventually fall out, then it make sense to conduct some experiments stretched out between several months to gauge the trend of growth and loss of the bitcoin economy."
p2
aS"You're right about the number of goods influencing the market size, of course. But we have no idea of the market size today, and whether we can pay our authors right now for writing books for the bitcoin market exclusively. If the experiment fails, we may try again in the future, or we may choose to publish non-exclusive material.I hope you'll notice that the target number of downloads is very low for that kind of book. If we can't reach 50 downloads now, we can hardly justify developing a website and signing contracts with authors."
p3
aS"I think trying to sell books developed exclusively for purchase via bitcoins is the wrong approach. You're better off just offering your entire catalog with BTC as a payment option next to whatever your current methods are. This eliminates the risk you have of the BTC market not being large enough and you don't have to launch an entire new website dedicated to BTC, just add on to what you are using now. This also serves the development of bitcoins by exposing your current customers to BTC rather than merely those of us who are already aware, which might get some of them interested in participating in other aspects of the BTC economy which helps grow the whole pie."
p4
aS"This is good advice. It seems like you have a gift shop near the boarder and want to start taking Canada bucks, but are only going to accept them on one new untested item and determine your future with the currency based on how that item sells. There is just no reason I can see to write books especially for the bitcoin market, unless they are going to be about bitcoin or currency or something, but even then why wouldn't you sell them for dollars since you are already set up for that?"

aS"Well, like I said, we're testing the market, it's an experiment. If nobody cares about buying ebooks sold exclusively for bitcoins, then we'll try something else. Now, a few pragmatic reasons to sell books exclusively for bitcoins, and you'll see we're not bullshitting you:- we can target our audience better, as bitcoins early adopters will tend to be more geeky and scientific people- people might want to support a bitcoin project, and pay a little more in bitcoins that what they would pay in dollars- having bitcoin-specific material is an incentive to use bitcoins- some authors don't want to get paid in bitcoins yet, but will feel robbed if we pay them at the current exchange rate, and the rate goes more favorable to bitcoin in the future. It's much easier to have with specific contracts for bitcoin sales, and our first author wanted to write a new edition of his book, so...Anyway, there won't be any hard feelings if the experiment doesn't work, and we won't turn our back to Bitcoin."

p8
aS"Sales are not doing well, so far, but it's been less than one day.We might release the final book on several formats, but PDF has been an open standard since 2008 and we don't use any kind of DRM or Adobe-specific features. I don't really see the point in releasing an ODT version, but an HTML one could be useful if you want to read the book on a small device."

aS'Since I have been involved with the seduction community for several years now, I thought it would be a good idea if I shared my thoughts about this guide.Executive summary for the impatient: Though it is hard to tell what the full guide is like based on only a few pages, I cannot recommend this guide to anyone.In depth review:I\'ve read a lot of guides and self-help books in this area. I enjoy learning about new perspectives, and this case is no different. However, I doubt it would be useful for anyone serious about dating.First, I know a lot of people in the seduction and dating coach community, but I\'ve never heard of Alejandro, the writer of this guide. To be fair, the community is very large and I can\'t know everyone. Since I don\'t recognize him, I can\'t evaluate his abilities as a seducer or dating coach.The writing could use some work. In the introduction, the writer promises to write in a clear and simple language which he mostly delivers on. However, there are extensive typos throughout the 8 pages as if the guide had not been reviewed before release. Also, the grammar and sentence structure becomes awkward in places. That being said, I found it easy to read and I was never left wondering what he was talking about.The goal of the book is to break down the seduction process and teach each step to the reader in an easy to understand and apply way. After reading the guide, I\'m not sure the writer actually applies what he writes. The information seems vague as if the writer doesn\'t have a firm grasp on the concepts he\'s teaching. It is possible, this being only the introduction to the guide, the writer simply hasn\'t had time to go into depth on any one topic. If that is the case, he doesn\'t say anything about going into more depth later on many of the topics covered.Notes on specific points in the book:Step 1: You.After the introduction to the guide this is the only step covered in this excerpt. Apparently, not all of step 1 is covered in this excerpt and it\'s not clear how much more is in this step. I hope it is considerably more. The concept of improving your psychology for dating, often referred to as "inner game" in the community, is huge. Many instructors I\'ve met consider "inner game" the only concept in the field.Step 1 is broken down into 3 sections, A few myths about what women like, How is this about you, and Being interesting."A few myths about what women like" simply lists five myths many men have about women. It\'s not exhaustive, but it does hit the most important ones. I have quick notes on each myth:Myth 1: Women like jerks, not nice guysThe writer refutes the myth well by listing several facts. However, he seems to miss the big misconception about why women like jerks (assertiveness). In the end, he almost seems to suggest women really do like jerks.Myth 2: Women are attracted to moneyHe pretty much nails this one. My only problem with his debunking is the use of the word "power". He seems to be using it in place of "social status" which is what most science articles and journals call it. In the seduction community, they call it "value" or having "high value" vrs "low value". It\'s clear he knows of the seduction community terms in other parts of the guide, but completely misses or ignores "social status" which seems to fit his explanation of what\'s going on much better.Myth 3: Women are attracted to good looking menHe pretty much nails this one as well. Again, he talks of power though.Myth 4: Women don\'t like sexNails it. Enough said.Myth 5: Women can be manipulatedNot only does he nail this one as well, but his answer should be shouted at everyone in the community. Best part of the guide.Now that he\'s covered all of the myths, the writer turns theses myths back on the reader in the section "How is this about you". Each myth above is restated as a belief you have about yourself which perpetuates the above myths. My first issue is with the way he phrases each belief. Though I\'m not exactly sure how, I think nearly all of them could be worded better.Belief 1: You\'re too nice, you\'re too meanThe writer totally screws this one up. The problem is, he completely ignores assertiveness and boundaries. Instead he simply tells the reader to be a little mean sometimes (among other things).Belief 2: You\'re too poorAgain he talks of power and introduces influence. Yet, he doesn\'t really relate the two (though it\'s obvious how he thinks they should be related). In both cases he could use "social status" and the explanation works. It even works with this counter examples, better than power or influence does. Otherwise, he seems to be correct on this point.Belief 3: You\'re too uglyOk, my experience, even within the seduction community which prides itself on being ugly yet still being successful, I\'ve found not having good looks is very hard to overcome. But his explanation is the same as any one else in the seduction community. Except, again he talks of power instead of social status or value. He even mentions "displaying high value" as a community term for his term "radiating power". There is a lot more which could be said about this topic. I\'m guessing he cut his explanation short and will return to it later in the guide.Belief 4: You\'re too shyCompletely wrong! First he tries to guess what you think the consequences will be and gets it wrong. Then he basically says, get over it. Not only is this wrong, but potentially damaging to people with this problem. He doesn\'t mention anything about where this belief really comes from. Not even the no actual way to prove it but it sounds plausible evolutionary psychology theory of why we\'re anxious around women which is all over the seduction community.There are two major problems guys have when trying "pickup" or date women. One is not having the skills, and the other is "being too shy". There are plenty of good techniques out there which deal with "being too shy". The writer seems to totally not understand the issue, and brushes it aside.Total fail.Belief 5: You\'re trying too hardHe has three explanations for this. The first two are basically the same. This belief is really part of Belief 4, but he doesn\'t mention it. Probably because he doesn\'t understand Belief 4.Now that the writer got some background out of the way he introduces some actual techniques in the section "Being interesting"."Being interesting" is broken down into 3 parts, Culture, Passions and Hobbies.In Culture, the writer basically says, go study a little about everything so you can sound knowledgeable. Knowing a little about everything is useful for small talk and getting conversations started sometimes, but he doesn\'t explain this. Instead he just tells you a bunch of things you should study without really explaining why. On top of that, some of the things he says you should study will be dated or are already dated.In Passions he says... Find a passion. There is a little explanation of why this is important, but he misses at least one important concept with passions. The section is very short, and could easily be rolled into the next section, Hobbies.In Hobbies, the writer tells you to find a hobbie. Then he gives you a list of reasons why they are important and offers suggestions for hobbies.In all of the "Being interesting" section, he seems to miss the overarching and far more important concept of identity. Maybe it\'s in a later section. Though, I would have expected it\'s introduction in the very beginning of this section to tie the following parts together.Finally, I have to mention the bibliography. Though he mentions concepts from the seduction community, the only book he lists in the bibliography is "The 48 Laws of Power". That book is only very indirectly related to seduction. He doesn\'t even mention anything from the book from what I can tell. The only thing related is his use of the term "power" everywhere. Interestingly, the same author wrote a book called "The Art of Seduction", which definitely is related yet gets no mention in the bibliography.Anyways, I spent way too long writing reviewing this guide. Honestly, it\'s only 0.1 bitcoin. If you\'re interested, check it out. Just don\'t expect to get much use out of it.'
p11
aS'Thanks for your review, morpheus. We\'d be happy to provide you with the full book for free if you\'re interested. It is, at the moment, being polished and proof-read. We\'re glad to see that, even if you don\'t recommend the book, you often state that it is spot on. I hope that some of the negative points you saw will be corrected in the full book.A few points:- Alejandro is not american, that may be part of the reason you never heard of him if you are american yourself. This is also the reason why his grammar might be sometimes a little rough around the edges. Anyway, he is no world renouned pick-up artist.- I believed it is stated in the excerpt that the concept of power is expanded upon in a later section of the book. Alejandro believes that social status is only a part of power.- The reason the bibliography contains only one item is that it\'s an excerpt: you get the only reference quoted in the text, but there are a few more, including "The Art of Seduction" and some famous seduction books, including those by Mystery and Style.- Some of the points are treated in more details later, including the part about being shy. Some techniques are treated in the part about meeting women. The point of the chapter you read was to skim on every misconception that one might have about himself, but not be too chatty about them. So the paragraph just says: there is no point in being shy, there is no risk in talking to women. How to actually overcome shyness is a more difficult and could not be explained in one paragraph.'

aS'having good game is not an excuse to make up for your poor life. it should be supplementary (gaming chicks) fun. sometimes in my life girls becomes an everyday part, and in other times it\'s not even thought about for a while.so all of this "get a hobby", "learn culture"... you should be doing that anyway to be a well rounded person! not because you think chicks will like you for it- otherwise it\'s just a false dichotomy.some people care too much about stupid shit (mental baggage) that really they just need to gain emotional freedom & stop worrying.'

Sure I will be spreading the word (the more people use BTC the more it's worth to everyone who uses it) but there must be something specifically usefull about me being in China. Maybe not but it would be nice."

p8
aS"We have an IM client/network here called QQ, by numbers I think it is the most popular IM network in the world, but it is mostly based in China (it is owned by TenCent, a Chinese company). You could by QQ coins which could be used to buy items for your or other persons QQ avatars. They became so popular that ordinary people were begining to accept them as currency for some goods (mostly young people). It became so popular that the government banned the use of QQ coins as a trading coin, that is to buy things outside the QQ network.BTC will remain ignored by the government here until it becomes popular, and then it will be banned. All bitcoin websites and services will be blocked. Simply searching for the word may have your internet connection cut off for a few minutes. For those who have the bitcoin client installed they will be unable to connect to the BTC network as the IRC server that the client gets the network nodes IP's will be blocked.This is the same problem facing Tor. "
p9
aS'How? They are identifying and blocking each Tor relay?'
p10
aS'Yes they are. :/'
p11
aS'Exactly, the government here has a lot of manpower at its disposal. To get the ip of a Tor relay it need only send an email to bridges@torproject.org with the subject "get bridges". The torproject will then reply will the ip address of 3 bridges.It will only reply once every 24hours and the email must be from GMail. But it only takes a 10 man team (including one script writer) a week to set up enough GMail email accounts and automate the process so that the majority of bridge node ip addresses can be harvested. Preventing most people from using Tor from within China.'
p12
aS"From the way you describe how your government seems to block TOR I would think there would be more easy ways to do that. On the other hand, they don't seem to just block encrypted content. So, having 2 hosts (one in China, one outside) creating an encrypted tunnel and let bitcoin traffic going through that solves the bitcoin network issues (as long as they don't know what the two hosts are exchanging you don't raise any flag). You might want to have a few of these tunnels to prevent network splits in case one of the hosts goes down.On the other side, things to spend the bitcoins on... that is a different thing. I think however that it doesn't relate to the QQ coins (I have Chinese colleagues seen using QQ and always wondered what it was), mainly because bitcoin isn't limited to China (the Chinese government hasn't any control about internet outside China) and as Bitcoin keeps growing, it becomes harder and more expensive for them to block it."

Kind of like the facebook of mtgox's.I'd be willing to write this (should be easy) and put the code out there. Could even be hosted by MagicalTux (he's willing).When each person registers, the server generates them a random string ID which is used for their accounts. They can then choose to trade with someone using any escrow of their choosing.However, how would you hook-up your own native currency? Is the format too restrictive? Maybe it's just better to provide exchange software and let others use it."

aS'There are some currency exchange applications available but seem unsuported and out of date. Mostly for LETS type systems.But this is not the problem, how is the RMB given to the purchaser? How can they use their RMB that they have bought with BTC? How can they get it? And how can someone who wishes to purchase BTC get their RMB to the exchanger?This kind of system is entirely illegal here, even electronically there is no way to transfer RMB out of the country. From account to account (in China) you must use UnionPay, it is the only interbank transfer service in China. For online processing you must use ChinaPay.BTC coming in is no difficult problem, but how to redeem your exchange, ok you know you have RMB, held for you in China, what then?Oh! An idea! A purchasing service! That would also be needed.I need to state again that this system would be totally illegal here, if it were to begin it would need to be in the black market. Otherwise it cannot operate. I think this is possible though if the trading/exchange system was available over i2p.'

aS'QQ/BTC exchange site could be made?Tor bridges sold for BTC so china gov has to mine? '

aS'Yes, to be legal, this exchange would be limited to in-country, China-only RMB deposits and withdrawals.This is similar to https://btcex.com/ which only permits deposit/withdrawal of Rubles in Russia, too, if I understand correctly.Each exchange must comply with national money transfer laws.'
p21
aS'Good idea. I was thinking something like that recently. One problem of these anonymous p2p networks is the lack of monetary incentive for those who donate their bandwidth. Plus, with this China thing, not only you need to be willing to donate bandwidth freely, as you\'ll also have your IP blocked from accessing anything inside the Great Firewall.If we could figure out a way to combine Tor and BTC in order to allow micro-donations to those who contribute with their bandwidth, this could create a better incentive for more Tor relays. If a protocol could be developed in a way that Tor relays would only redirect "paying traffic", this could bring professional, profit oriented players to the Tor network, and bust its bandwidth considerably.But it\'s a bit hard to implement such a thing in a way that scales... paying for each data packet would create an immense amount of overhead to both networks, so there should be some sort of "long term subscription"...Anyway, it\'s complicated...

A simple web based "rent tracking" application could be made. The application lets you know if the rent has been paid, also it would keep the payment in escrow to ensure the service is delivered. It wouldn\'t be too difficult to implement, as no actual Tor/BTC integration is required. The renter and rentee would need to keep track of their usage(aided by the web based application) which would manage the payments through an escrow.'

p2
aS'Yeah, I was counting a texture as part of the mesh.\xc2\xa0 Neither the mesh or texture need to be of finished quality, just something that works well enough so you can see what creatures are there and roughly what they should look like in the finished game.\xc2\xa0 That way we can see how everything works together before we get to far along on the individual models.-Buck'
p3
aS"As a 3D artist that payment is diddly squat for the hours put in to:- Concept draw & research a model.- Model the base mesh.- Optimise the tris for a video game.- UV unwrap a mesh optimally to maximise texture space.- Paint a texture.- Optionally create a bump-map & any other shader textures.- Create an animation rig.- Skin the model.- Create several animations.- Export model to a working in-game format.You haven't thought this through very well... $50 is incredibly optimistic."
p4
aS'I am willing to pay more than that for good models as I made clear in my original post.\xc2\xa0 I am not looking for completed works, just something that has roughly the size and shape of the intended creature to allow for testing of animation speeds, onscreen size, etc.\xc2\xa0 We also need to tune how many hitpoints creatures have and what kind of damage they do and if you have models for them (even very rough ones) it makes that process much easier.\xc2\xa0 Hence I was offering something like 10 to 20 dollars per model for just a basic mesh and very rough animations (just enough to work out the timing with sounds, animation length, speed, etc).The list you gave is an accurate list for a fully constructed model which should cost in excess of 100 dollars for a good one, however what I am looking for here is more like 3d concept art, or a mockup of what the finished game should look like.\xc2\xa0 If anyone is interested but feels the prices or approach I am offering is incorrect please let me know.-Buck'

Best to get it right the first time- decide on mesh sizes using boxes then on a walkspeed for walk-cycles by measurement. If you later decide to change the mesh then things like UV-unwrapping, skinning, ... will be messed up and need fixing.It's not something like coding where you place a mesh in-game, tweak it, re-export, tweak, ... It's more like here's the constraints (size, various anim speeds, tri-count, texture sizes, ...), make a model fitting those. Then after each step you don't go back (generally)."
p6
aS"BTW those models on that page are rigged/animated... I'll give them to you $25 each if you want them. However their movements are exaggerated and simplistic because they were made for a zoomed out strategy game where the meshes are seen from a far-away distance.But the dragon and the girl have no animation/rigging."
p7
aS"Your offer of $25 for models on your page sounds like something we could do.\xc2\xa0 I am not willing to pay 300 per model at this stage because we don't even know for sure we will use all the creatures we are currently talking about so I don't want to invest too heavily into any one model yet, maybe in the future though if the game does well.\xc2\xa0 I have posted a reply over in the Open Dungeons forum to about which models I think look interesting so our other developers can look at them and see what we want.\xc2\xa0 You are welcome to jump into that thread as well if you want to participate in that discussion as well.\xc2\xa0 I think for a license we would want CC-BY-SA but I would also have to confirm that with the other developers, I don't remember what we are using for the artwork right offhand.-Buck"

S'OK, here\'s the deal.I have joined some PTC sites, and would like to see how much "clicking" labour I can buy for my BitCoin.If you don\'t know, PTC sites pay very little, like 1 cent per click, of which 4 clicks are minimum a day. This allows a clicker to earn about $1.20 a month.I am willing to pay any individual one BitCoin for 30 continuous days of clicking 4 ads on a site I have signed up to as my direct referral. As my referral I do not steal any of the cash you earn from the site, you get to keep the $1.20 you make, but for every click you do, I get half a cent.For example, if you click 4 ads a day, you will get 4 cents a day, and I will get 2 cents a day, so the site pays both of us 6 cents a day in total.Out of the 2 cents I earn from you a day, I will pay you 1 BitCoin (I can only afford this if the price for BitCoins stay around $0.30 to $0.50 each).I know it is tiny amounts, but I would like to start off small first to earn trust. I have more sites that I have signed up to and there is a potential to earn more, depending on how much "work" you want to do.Clicking to view ads doesn\'t take much time at all, each ad takes up about 1 minute to look at? So let us say, just to be on the safe side, this would cost you about 15 minutes of your time a day? Plus you have the potential to increase your earnings through rented referrals etc.I will pay upon completion of the contract, which is 30 days of clicking without a gap. Every 15 days I will pay half a BitCoin, so you get income twice a month.If you are interested, or have any questions, please don\'t hesitate to PM me. Or if you have any advice or constructive criticism, please don\'t hesitate to post on this thread.Many thanks'
p1
aS'[edited]So, what industry will be the first to get clobbered by bitcoin?CPC advertising is one that is quite vulnerable to anonymity + micropayments + remote workforce.\xc2\xa0/ me thinks it might be a good time to reconsider using CPC advertising. \xc2\xa0 :-)'
p2
aS"i first though, you made up a new PTC site that pays in bitcoins, had that idea myself (to offer another way to 'earn' bitcoins), seems you only want refs on some 'usual' PTCs though.it also doesn't make much sense to me, let's say it takes 1minute and you get 1cent,that's a whole 60cents for an hour of work (as stupid as it is, it's still work todo), that's not actually an impressive amount of money.if you're willing to work for less than a dollar per hour, i guess there's some better jobs out there. "
p3
aS'This sounds rather unethical.'
p4
aS"I haven't set up my own BitCoin PTC site as of yet  I don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.My primary goal is to circulate BitCoin amongst more users.I understand that that is a low amount for now, however, one is not considering the amount of money they are earning by themselves anyway, money which they could re-invest with rent referrals in the site.So in reality, their earnings a month will be $1.20 + 1 BTC. Which is about 4 BTC, at the current exchange rate.I don't see how this is unethical, could you please explain? Should some adjustments be made?"
p5
aS"It's unethical because you are offering incentive for people to click the ad and take money from the advertiser when the don't give a sh*t about the product."
p6
aS"Nah man!That's not what product-people are buying! They are buying exposure. Just like companies who spend money on billboards, does that mean everyone who looks at it has an obligation to be interested in it? If an advertiser paid you a bit to look at their advert is that unethical?True I offer an incentive, but the incentive is for people to get exposed to the products, not to nessecarily buy them."
p7
aS"no, see there is passive and active. Looking is passive, clicking is active. Let's take your billboard example the advertiser pays a flat rate. You want to pay people to look at it knock yourself out, your only hurting yourself. Much like if they paid a flat rate for a banner on a site, you could pay people to click it but that would just be stupid. Now let's take clicking let's say with organic traffic 10% of clicks results in a sale so they budget 5% for advertising, making them have a 5% profit. With your incentives it dilutes it to 3% of clicks, guess what they are losing 2%."

S'Hi!I\'m just discovering Bitcoin, and I\'m very impressed. The usual stuff people say: that\'s exactly what I was looking for, a realistic way to get independant from the banks and govs, blah, blah. \xc2\xa0So far I own 2.05 BTC \xc2\xa0 (2 a friend gave me, plus .05 from the bitcoin faucet), so I\'m looking for a way to earn some more, so that I can start paying with Bitcoins instead of euros.So first I would like to propose translation services. I\'m French, and I live in Mexico, so I speak fluent Spanish. I also speak average English. I\'d like to translate only *to* my native language, though, which is the common practice in translation, unless you don\'t mind not-so-natural phrasing.I\'m also a SPIP web developper. By the way, I just started a SPIP Bitcoin plugin. For the moment, it just adds a "bitcoin address" field in SPIP authors\' profile, so that the field is available when designing page templates. More features will appear as soon as I come up with more ideas (maybe a #MODELE for easier "I accept Bitcoin payments, here\'s my address" announcement?). Of course, if you like the idea, if you want to participate, give more ideas... or bitcoins, please do!I can also do system administration, mostly with Debian, which is my everyday and only OS. Here is my r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9: http://da.weeno.net/cv/en/Bye!'

I don't really have a problem with your exchange rate, but I'd feel bad for anyone who might make a purchase which they wouldn't have otherwise made if they had been more familiar with how your exchange works. Perhaps you could also dynamically display the spread percentage. I think it's good that your rate adapts to supply and demand, but I think it would be better if the spread percentage was high with low volume and low with higher volume. Of course that may be difficult to do when the exchange rate changes dynamically. Perhaps i just need to refresh my math skills. If I'm missing something fundamental about how your exchange rate works, please fill me in when you've got some spare time."
p9
aS"Here's a pic that hopefully helps to explain the calculation of my exchange rate. The \xc2\x80-value of a Bitcoin transaction is the area under the exchange rate curve between points P1 and P2 on the x-axis, where P1 is my BTC reserves before the transaction, and P2 after the transaction. When you sell 10000 BTC and buy them back before someone else does, the spread (my profit margin) is always about 2%."

S"Ok, I don't have one yet, My coding skills may or may not be up to actually making one.\xc2\xa0 But I thought a prediction market in bitcoins would be a good idea.\xc2\xa0 Because of their anonymous nature it would allow for a wider range of possible predictions than the currently available markets.\xc2\xa0 My thought is a market in which anyone can offer something to be predicted, with the site admins taking a cut for judging which way it has gone.\xc2\xa0 Things to be predicted could be submitted and then the judges would decide if they are able to judge that particular thing, and how much they would charge to do so, if they can't judge it it is rejected, if they can but the judge's fee is not met then the market is dissolved at the end and bids are returned.\xc2\xa0 If they can judge it and the judge fee is met that is subtracted and the rest divided among those with correct predictions based on their market share."
p1
aS"I think multiple peer judges who don't know who each other are until afterwards and get paid for choosing the same way as the majority might be a good way to go."
p2
aS'I agree.\xc2\xa0 The challenge then becomes how to decide the judging fee.\xc2\xa0 Obviously something like "Obama wins presidential election in 2012" is much easier to judge than "homelessness rate in Topeka Kansas doubles by dec 31st 2011" (I had trouble coming up with a really hard one, but I know they are out there)\xc2\xa0 '
p3
aS'I\'ve wanted a predictions market since I first heard about bitcoin.\xc2\xa0 It is the perfect medium for a predictions market.\xc2\xa0 As for judging fee, it should be pretty minimal.\xc2\xa0 Even for "hard" ones like "homelessness rate doubles", the criteria just needs to be very very specific.\xc2\xa0 For example:"On July 20th 2011 The annually reported homelessness rate by detroit.gov will be equal to or above two times the number reported on July 20th 2010.\xc2\xa0 Should Detroit.gov not publish a homelessness rate on July 20th 2011, then the number reported by..."As long as you give ridiculously detailed criteria, then disputable outcomes should be very very rare.'
p4
aS'Haha, Babylon: \xc2\xa0That\'s very easy to judge, but different people will come up with different answers, and still consider it an "easy" choice. =P'
p5
aS"That still requires judgement if the submission of predictions is open, which I think it should be.\xc2\xa0 You need someone to judge if a question is sufficiently precise.\xc2\xa0 This could, of course, be the job of the prediction market admin, who would hire on more admins as the market grew to require more judges.\xc2\xa0 I'm just not sure if that is the most elegant solution."
p6
aS"I think it can be taken care of naturally.When you propose a prediction you spell out all terms in detail, including the judging fee. When X judges have volunteered you randomly pick a subset of them and let the trading begin. As a judge or bettor I'd be most comfortable with very clear terms. If judges only get paid when they agree with a majority then judges will prefer easy to judge terms because they are much more likely to get paid. It doesn't have to be a simple majority either. Maybe 3/4 or 7/10, this can be specified in the details.I expect standard forms for terms would emerge and would be self reinforcing because it's easiest to predict how people will judge in established formats.If someone gets this up, I promise to lose a lot of money predicting all sorts of things inaccurately. "
p7
aS"heh, win or lose the hosting site makes money because they take a small cut.\xc2\xa0 Like Mt Gox exchange.\xc2\xa0 Any of you coding sorts out there have an idea how this could be set up?\xc2\xa0 my coding skills are pretty minimal but I'd love to be involved in some way."
p8
aS"Sure the site makes money off of hosting, but having a big spending loser will attract others, which will give the site more to rake. ;-)Of course, my prediction is that my predictions are bad, so what's that worth?"
p9
aS'That\'d be an interesting prediction for you to set up."User freemoney will lose more money than he makes on bitpredictions site between August 16th 2010 and August 31st 2010"I am checking out open source prediction market software right now.\xc2\xa0 '
p10
aS"I'm not sure I understand the concepts at play here, but if you give me detailed specifications on what it should do, I could probably code it for you ( for a small bitcoin fee, of course =) )."
p11
aS'ok, it\'s a futures market.\xc2\xa0 The things that users would be able to do would be suggest something to predict (such as "Will Barak Obama win the 2012 Presidential Election" or "Will there be more than 3" of rainfall on June 13th 2011 in the greater Seattle Area as reported by the Seattle Post Intelligencer") this puts the predictions into a "looking for judges" pool.\xc2\xa0 The person proposing the prediction also sets a judging fee, which will be subtracted from the total and divided equally among judges voting in the majority.\xc2\xa0 Once enough judges sign up the prediction is opened to the users who can then purchase either a yes or a no with a certain spread between them.\xc2\xa0 The price of yes and no\'s updates with each transaction and is based on how many users have chosen that answer (and how many shares in that answer they have purchased).\xc2\xa0 When the issue is resolved the total is divided among the users based on share ownership.\xc2\xa0 It would need to be secure, and it would probably be a good idea for users to be able to establish accounts which they may deposit bitcoins into, withdraw bitcoins from, use to purchase yesses or noes, and have bitcoins deposited into when a market closes.From a quick look at Open Source possibilities for this it looks as if Serotonin Prediction Markets may be an already existing solution.\xc2\xa0 However I have not dug into just what it is and how it works, or how easy it would be to convert it to bitcoin.I am, at the moment, poor in both cash and coin,\xc2\xa0 I do have access to some server space and might be able to cover coder fees, depending on how much they come to.\xc2\xa0 If I cannot I may also consider a shared enterprise if people are interested in joining as financial backers. (obviously the business model needs some work before it gets to that point)'
p12
aS'What would the judges do?\xc2\xa0 '
p13
aS'Judge the results.\xc2\xa0 So let\'s say it is the day after election day and Obama has just won the 2012 election.\xc2\xa0 The judges would log in and click on "yes" and the users that had bought yes shares would be paid out.This is an extremely easy prediction, since it is covered in international news and verified in strict ways.\xc2\xa0 The market would be able to handle both easy and hard judging situations however.\xc2\xa0 If someone set up a prediction for instance, that "The world will be a better place on December 31st 2012 than it is today (July 19th 2010)"\xc2\xa0 this is an incredibly subjective question.\xc2\xa0 However it can still be judged and what people are essentially speculating on is what the majority of selected judges will decide in regards to the question. '
p14
aS'Ah ok.Proposed revision:\xc2\xa0 Once you open up the question to the public, they vote on the prediction, as well on a 1 to 10 scale of subjectivity.\xc2\xa0 This is then averaged, and determines the "percentage split" between how the funds are split up majority/minority somehow.\xc2\xa0 So an extremely subjective question, the judges aren\'t penalized for their answer as much, because it could have gone either way.'
p15
aS'makes sense.\xc2\xa0 0-4 might be a better scale, with 0 meaning 100% goes to the winners and winning judges, 1 meaning 10% to the minority, 2 meaning 20% etc.\xc2\xa0 (of course this would get averaged and could be given to users as a 1-5 scale)'

So if 600 BTC sits in the "bank" (server in this case) and someone wins pick 3, they get 500 BTC and the remaining 100 BTC starts the next pick 3 winner jackpotIf no one wins, the jackpot will be used to start another new pick 3 and another date (probably just a few days into the future) will be used to pick the next winning number.There can be multiple winners, so then the winnings are split up (this also further helps to prevent someone from buying every possible number for a guaranteed win)Your 1 BTC and pick number are sent directly to a static IP address: 64.186.155.104 -- This is an 8-core server generating BTC (around 6000 khash/s) every day 24/7/365. Anything it generates on it\'s own (50 BTC) will also be added to the jackpot for the winner. I\'ve reset it\'s balance to 0, so it\'s basically now going to be the jackpot holding machine. Please include either your BTC address or IP Address (if you have a static) along with the number you picked, otherwise I won\'t know where to send the winner the BTCWinning numbers (evening drawing) will be taken from my states official website here so you can check for yourself: http://www.tnlottery.com/If you can pick up the local broadcast stations here, you can see the drawing live on TV as well.When the lotto jackpot runs out of the money, no more lotto. So if we have a bunch of winners in a row, I\'ll have to decide if I want to chuck my BTC into the jackpot to start it again if it\'s unable to maintain itself from too many lucky winners (or people with time machines)No last minute submissions. Our timezone here is (-6:00 CST). No more submissions will be accepted *after* noon (12:00PM -6:00 CST) on the day of the drawing. If you send a coin to the server after that time, I\'ll return it. If you send a coin with no return address or way to know *who* sent it, it just goes into the winning pot for the next drawing.Questions are welcome, I\'ll be glad to answer them here.I\'ve just transfered 100 BTC to get it started.Winner will be whoever got the lucky pick 3 match with the evening state drawing on 7/21/2010 (This Wednesday)Good luck to you all !! (kisses his 100 BTC goodbye to the winner \xc2\xa0 )I\'ll make another after post up a list of all the numbers that were *picked* by those that entered for further verification (just the numbers, not who for privacy reasons)'

p4
aS'Send to IP: 64.186.154.76Be sure to include the numbers picked and the address to send the winnings to it you win. The direct IP allows you to use the "from" and "message" fields.Thanks for playing and the best of luck to you!'

aS"Doh.\xc2\xa0 I assumed this was like the previous lottery I saw, and didn't read the whole post. ^.^"
p7
aS"It's cool, I've updated topic as well with the new jackpot balance and the picked numbers.In case anyone was curious, two people can pick the same number, but if that number wins, both people have to split the winnings."
p8
aS'Can you somehow indicate how many times each has been picked?'
p9
aS"Yeah, I'll start double-up (like 213 - 213 side by side) the ones that have multiple people picking it. That's one thing I didn't like about our own state lotto pick 3, lots of people would play (it was a $500 prize only) but you had no idea what numbers every else picked, so you often had multiple winners splitting the prize and each not getting very much when they won, LOL."
p10
aS'Buying 557, 675, 006, 783, 585, 460, 524, 218, 401 and 832; numbers brought to you by random.org.\xc2\xa0 '
p11
aS'Could you perhaps make a lower value BitCoin lottery for those of us with less than one BitCoin? Us smaller users are having a hard time generating anything. '
p12
aS"Yes, actually I was thinking that also. Since most can only get 0.05 from the faucet website, I thought about making a 5 BTC prize lotto, where 0.01 is the entry fee for the ticket. The problem is, I don't know if I could handle the amount of entries since someone could easily chuck in 100 entries for only 1 BTC. Would probably take some website automation for that."
p13
aS"Thanks, I'll add those to the list here shortly. Seems the network provider is having issues, as it's really slow to connect to the server(s) right now for me.[edit] Updated jackpot and picked numbers."

For instance, if someone pays a fraction of a unit for the lotto, it can be returned and also so that the winner is automatically paid."
p19
aS"Yeah, at least from the GUI standpoint, if someone doesn't put in what BC address sent it to you, so I don't see a way to refund it.I haven't looked through the headless server version to see how the data is handled for that.Basically, someone would have to pay through direct IP and make sure they put in the from field, the BC address or else it's no different than a stranger in the street stuffing $20 in your pocket as you walk by and you never see that person again and don't know who it was."

p26
aS"I'll start another topic that will start a new one and this jackpot will be used to start the next lotto. At the same time, I start a separate lotto that is pick 3, but using a smaller jackpot, so those that get 0.05 BC from the free BC site can participate."
p27
aS"So you're starting a new lotto, with new tickets?\xc2\xa0 Or just continuing on until a number gets drawn, with people keeping their numbers?"
p28
aS"New lotto, new tickets just like the state lotto. I thought about just leaving it and continue on, but I looked over the last months winning numbers and even with the list of choices, no one would have won all month, which surprised me given how random the choices look. This being my first lotto, I would hate for it to go on for months with no winner because no one will want to play if no one is winning. That's why I set the next drawing in a few days, and if we still don't have any winners, I might just start using the daily drawing because someone has gotta win at some point or else no one will want to play (or they will just start playing the penny lotto instead since they can buy a ton more numbers for cheaper)"

S'Lottos are fun, especially if it doesn\'t cost much to play. This one is a penny lotto. So those new to BitCoin and visit the https://freebitcoins.appspot.com/ website can give it a few tries.I\'m going to duplicate my states pick three lotto. It\'s easy and straight forward, plus I\'ll use the results from the actual state lotto for fairness. I\'m not going to take a percentage of any winnings, so winner takes all (including all mine if you win).Rules:Cost to Enter: 0.01 BTCWhat do you pick? Any number between 000 and 999; 000 counts as a number, so does 009, 099, etcYou can enter as many times as you like for 0.01 BTC each, so you can pick multiple numbersThe maximum (but not minimum) jackpot will always be 5 BTC, the reason for this; it prevents someone from just buying all the numbers for a guaranteed win.

Feel free to list them voluntarily if you like. But when the day of the drawing takes place, I will make certain to double check the logs to make sure all winners get their prize.If the server generates a 50 BTC amount, then that opens up the ability to have multiple winners get the full 5 BTC prize without having to split it up. If that happens, I\'ll be sure to update the topic as well.'

aS'This server just generated another 50 BTC, so now the prize winnings will work different. Basically, 5 BTC to all winners (even if two people pick the same number) Awesome!'

S'I was considering starting something like a "real time lotto", but wanted to probe the community first.How would everyone here feel about a lotto that works as following:I, or some third party, would choose a random number and keep it a secret, and put several bitcoins into the pot to get things going.People begin to guess numbers at 1btc each guess.\xc2\xa0 Each bitcoin goes into the pot.This continues until someone guesses the number, at which point 3 things happen:80% (or some other number, it\'s up to how people react) of the pot goes to the winner.1% goes to me (very modest, I should say)19% stays in the pot to get it started for the next one, and a random number is chosen again.This could be automated, as a (potentially) very fast paced lottery.So:\xc2\xa0 What numbers should I use above, or are the values I\'ve chosen reasonable?Would you prefer the "already guessed" numbers be shown?\xc2\xa0 Hidden?\xc2\xa0 Shown after they\'ve been guessed multiple times?Any other ideas/suggestions?'
p1
aS"I think it would be better if you found a source of random digits that isn't controlled by one or us. Maybe the last digits of some absurdly precise meteorological data that is published frequently.It's not that I don't trust someone for a few coins, but it'd be nice to have a system that scales and new people and unlucky people know can't be rigged."
p2
aS"How would I do this though?\xc2\xa0 The whole idea is that instead of a bunch of people guessing, then the numbers picked, a bunch of people pick and the first one to guess the number wins.\xc2\xa0 Otherwise it becomes a regular lottery, and the point is to be a bit different, so as not to tread on the other lottery's feet. "
p3
aS'I would do the drawing as follows:Go to random.org and generate the random number(s) between 0 and n based on a "persistent identifier". A good identifier to use would be a newly generated bitcoin address that has not been used yet.Post the SHA-256 hash of the identifier on the forum to commit to the number(s)Publish the guesses. This way, people can see if all guesses have been exhausted. This prevents me from claiming no-one won.Announce the winner and publish the identifier used to generate the number(s), so everyone can verify the winning number(s).'
p4
aS"What about the following:Have a lottery for N people (this can be varied from 2 to 100 -- maybe start with 2 for fun)Each enters 1 BTC and chooses one of the remaining numbers from 1 to N.Once N people are hit, take a timestamp. \xc2\xa0Then run that timestamp as a seed in a random number generator.This picks the winner.I'd suggest to start with all funds returned to participants at parity because:1. legal in most US states2. fun to get things going ...Later on you can add a rake, bonus system, jackpot etc, like poker sites do."
p5
aS"This is a very good solution.\xc2\xa0 I was looking around on random.org, but I hadn't thought it all the way through.\xc2\xa0 Would you be interested in buying into a lottery like this?\xc2\xa0 It's interesting, because it doesn't reward buying a bunch of guesses at once (each one gives diminishing returns, because you're putting more money into the pot) and the longer it goes on (maybe capped to a week, and whoever's closest after a week wins) the more profitable it would be, because there'd be less choices, thus more chances for winning.\xc2\xa0 It's almost like a Bingo lottery. =P"
p6
aS'Looks very cool!Maybe we can test out the coin flip?'
p7
aS'Well, I\'m running a "fake" one right now.\xc2\xa0 http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=534.0Also, the chance of them brute forcing a 64 digit alphanumeric seed which I hashed with SHA-256 is very low. '
p8
aS"*shrug* I can hash it a second time, but it's not going to increase or decrease security.\xc2\xa0 I typed out a random alphanumeric seed anywhere between 1 and 64 characters long, so they'd have to bruteforce an ungodly number of options.\xc2\xa0 Hashing it a second time won't change that."

S'I saw someone had mentioned Listia in a different thread.\xc2\xa0 I have decided to test the waters by auctioning 5 bitcoins on Listia.http://www.listia.com/?r=135367Search for BitCoinsAuction Ends: Sat July 31st 1:40 AM AZOST (Not sure what TZ that is, but it is 10 days from this post.)Listia lets you auction off stuff you have for credits.\xc2\xa0 You can then use those credits to bid on other auctions.\xc2\xa0 No need for cash to change hands.\xc2\xa0 In some ways it is like craigslist but without freeloaders.\xc2\xa0 You get some credits just for signing up and at random other times.'
p1
aS'What do freeloaders do on craigslist? Are listia credits pegged to the dollar?'
p2
aS'On craigslist (this is strictly for the give away free section) someone can get as much as they want but never have to give any of their stuff away,\xc2\xa0 they pull value from the system (by taking free stuff) without adding any value (by giving stuff away).\xc2\xa0 On listia, you have to put up auctions of your own in order to get the credits you need to bid on other stuff.Listia credits are not convertable to any other system (ie, not pegged to the dollar). You can use them exclusively on listia.\xc2\xa0 However, you can use them to get real things so they have value.\xc2\xa0 You are not allowed to auction cash but you can auction gift cards.\xc2\xa0 Based on the value of the items I see being auctioned I think the value of a credit on listia is somewhere between half a cent and a cent.Interestingly, you can pretty easily convert bitcoins to and from cash but it is harder to convert them to "stuff".\xc2\xa0 Listia is the opposite, it is easy to convert between listia credits and "stuff" but hard to convert them to cash.\xc2\xa0 I think this makes them complementary systems, you can auction your bitcoins for points which you buy stuff with and you can auction stuff and use the points to bid on bitcoins.'
p3
aS"What is the check on the managers? Why can't they just issue themselves credits?Craigslist freeloaders are the people who actually buy stuff, is this right?"
p4
aS'Listia credits are centrally controlled, the people who control it can do whatever they want, including give themselves credits.\xc2\xa0 This is like any other credit/money scheme with central control (and unlike bitcoin).\xc2\xa0 In fact, you can get credits at random times for doing things like checking in, listing auctions, giving feedback, etc.\xc2\xa0 Thus, there is inflation on Listia.As I mentioned in my second post, the freeloaders comment applies strictly to the "give away free" section of craigslist, so no, they don\'t actually buy stuff.'
