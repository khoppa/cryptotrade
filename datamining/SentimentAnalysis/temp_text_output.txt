aS"Any sort of investment has it's own risks so instead of asking strangers where should you invest your hard earned money, it's best if you do your own research and make calculated investments.

aS"There are a few options to grow your coin. Although there is (usually) an absense of 'no-risk' investments, some investments are less-risky than others.In no particular order, here are a few ways you can invest your coin for profits:- The most obvious, trading. Whether you use bots or trade yourself, this is by far the most common way to increase profits. Usually very risky, even more so with cryptocurrency, but the potential gains are extremely high. You should always so your research behind possible investments, and pay absolutley no attention to trollboxes, or you will fill your head full of extremely conflicting opinions and FUD.- Leverage trading. If you have a 'knack' for guessing the next price of Bitcoin, leverage trading on sites such as btc.sx , bitfinex.com & bit4ex.com , can be very rewarding, for very little work. Start small, and never invest more than you can lose.- Loaning. This is by-far the most risky. Time has shown us, that even some of your most valued customers that have never defaulted on a loan before, will have no problem defaulting on you in the future. This is not to say that every single person you loan to will run off and never be seen again, as there are of course people with a personal consciousness and morals, there will however be some that just do not care. - Stocks. Surprising there are not more stock sites that use cryptocoins, but this is nevertheless an option.- Gambling. Probably the most unhealthy of investments as they are designed to take advantage of human weakness and to gain profits. Although some have hit the 'jackpot' by pure luck. (See article here)There are of course others as well. But TBH, I just got really lazy. Mistercoin"

But you can grow those earning those without using them. You can participate in some signature campaign here at bitcointalk and you can earn sure bitcoins. More your account will grow and more will be the bitcoin you will earn. Then you can earn plying gaming but without investing nothing. If you will invest you for sure will lose even your invested money. I\'m playing a such game when no one ask for investment but you can win satoshi. For example I can win about 100 k satoshi every day (for the moment not this amount because i want to go ahead in game to earn more later) but this amount can be more. If you want I can send you with pm the reflink (to try if you want).'

Don`t get me wrong, I invested bitcoins in many altcoins, but not all of them are going up all the time, many of them are stuck on some price, and bitcoin is growing and there is a lot of good news about bitcoin, and big things that will happen to bitcoin.That is in the same time answer to OP`s question, its not too late to get in bitcoin now, bitcoin is not even 10 years old, bitcoin can grow more for sure.'

p6
aS"I have been telling people that it's never too late to enter the market since the price was moving well under the $500 level -- current levels are exactly the same. However, the moment of entering the market highly depends on the length of your investment target (i.e long or short term). Currently with SegWit activation being close, I would advice anyone to buy at current levels. I expect the price to hit $3000 tomorrow, or on Monday at latest. If you plan to invest, just make sure you never go all in. If you just stick to for example 25% at most, you'll have enough funds aside for when the price happens to go down. After all, we all can only speculate, do your own research before taking any actions."

p10
aS"If you are not in hurry than you can wait for some correction which is quite likely when price will touch $3k soon.

You already have $200 profit for it but that's not all about $3k value but it can go beyond and higher so there's a lot of time to invest and get in bitcoin. Think about when the price way back $1,000 and people are buying at $800 and they were never wrong with it."
p13
aS"I would suggest waiting until SegWit gets activated somewhere after August 1. Just wait until the prices and the general economy stabilises and you can always get in. Even if you are going in with $5, that $5 can be 10, 100 and so forth depending on what you'll be doing. Long term."
p14
aS"Quote from: wekael on July 22, 2017, 05:11:37 PMSegWit seems to be getting support so since the fork is not likely to happen on the 1st August things should look good until November now and the price should continue to rise, so it could be good to buy some now. Of course you already lost an amazing window of opportunity if you didn't bought some at $1800. I know I lost it, so I will probably just keep holding now."
p15
aS'Quote from: FrueGreads on July 22, 2017, 09:26:08 PMBut a lot of people still don\'t seem to realize that nothing is going to happen on the August 1 so I think once it passes without problems its going to gain a lot of value. In the long term obviously bitcoin always performs well too so in a few years from now everyone will be crying "why didn\'t I buy more when the price was only around "$2000".'

aS"Quote from: malami on July 22, 2017, 09:30:48 PMBy now so many people are sure of a moonshot starting on August 1 that I doubt it will actually happen.

There are many good ones out there and you could put your money into one of those at least temporarily and then trade for Bitcoins when you can get a good price.'

With some investing savvy, a significantly smaller initial investment can be multiplied many times more much faster."

aS"To trade in altcoins or shares you need to have the feeling for it and also practice a lot, I discourage this for beginners.If you can afford an ASIC miner and also endure the 80dB noise it makes then that's a nice way to earn Bitcoins.But I still think investing and keeping one coin for long term is the best way to generate profit, make sure you keep yourself up-to-dated of latest news about this particular coin.

ASIC mining has too many barriers to entry for small/casual miners. If I can mine it with my GPU rigs, and I think it has 100x potential, then you can bet that I'm mining it. But in general, I'm more of a trader. Mining is just a hobby, and I'm actually pretty early on the learning curve. I used to play poker heavily, and I found that the analytical/statistics skills I picked up there applied very well to trading. Quote from: kuronokishi10 on November 20, 2017, 05:26:25 PMYou need trading capital to trade. I suggest studying the basics on https://www.babypips.com and then starting with a small account. GPU mining takes overhead and I think it's better to develop a good feel for the altcoin markets before diving into it.

But unless you have six figures USD to drop into mining, stick to altcoins that you can mine with GPUs.Good luck!"

aS"If you want to solo mining bitcoin, this futile attempt unless you have free electricity, but hey it can be profiting if you mine some altcoin, some of them usually new coins with a good fundamental like MUE, have a price about 70-100 sats in the beginning. You don't necessarily need to have your GPU/ASIC ready to mining, there's site like nicehash who provide renting mining power.

Many factors needs to be considered before entering this trading. It has a higher risk compared to mining. You might even lose your investment if it doesn\xc2\x92t go as planned. But it can be very rewarding in the long run. Mining can be worth considering, it is just that its major drawback is it consumes too much electricity which adds to operational expenses compared to trading in which you only need a pc or smartphone and you are ready to go.

aS"For me it all boils down to two things which is capital and the patience to learn. If you purely want earning Bitcoin passively then what you need to do is mining which you will earn just by turning on your hardware. Now if you have the patience to learn what you are doing then it is best for you to trade as you will only need technical analysis skills and capital to start earning. Now if you choose mining purchasing the hardware doesn't stop the cost there as you still need to pay for electricity and the maintenance of your mining hardware."

On the other hand, if you choose mining just because somebody told you mining is better, and you're lacking knowledge and skills, you will end up gain nothing.So either way trading or mining can be profitable or very profitable versus the other, if you have the proper knowledge and skills to do it. Profit? Profit will always follow you"

Dealing with multiple cryptos, following many things... for me that is too much, but there are people who like that and that is their life. With trading you can make a lot of money, and for start you do not need a lot of money to invest.Mining on the other hand is different. You would need a lot of money to start. But at the end if you ask me, you can get even more money than from trading. One thing that mining have and trading doesn't... is free time. You don't have to do anything while your miner is mining. And even better, you can use that time for something other to do or make even more money.Now you see why combination of both would be best."

For me trading is much simpler, because we are only required a very basic thing is to buy at a cheap price and then sell it much more expensive.

aS'I earn quite well in trading than I did when I did mining. In mining, it takes a long time for you to finish a job. Moreover, it requires so much capital due to the operating costs that are quite expensive nowadays.

aS'I think trading is better. Nowadays it is very expensive to buy and power mining hardware, it requires more than 6 months to recover from your initial investment. The only exception to this is if you live in a country where electricity is particularly cheap in this case you can consider mining. And also hardware can break and if you send it to service you will lose more.'

aS'Quote from: kuronokishi10 on November 20, 2017, 05:26:25 PMBased on my opinion, trading is better than mining. The basic requirement for mining is knowledge, money, and equipment. You will need a good research before you get to the point that you will build mining rig to start mining. On the other hand, the basic requirement for trading is only knowledge and money. In trading, the money you spent will be recovered immediately while in mining, it will not be like that because nowadays mining is never profitable compared before. '

With mining, you\xc2\x92ll just have to make sure that your profit is always higher than your investment/expenses such as hardware upgrades and electricity cost. Invest and let the computer do all the work for you. Trading requires a lot of studying and monitoring, which is time consuming.'
p192
aS'both of them are profitable. both of them also requires a good capital to start with but trading is much riskier than mining as it requires luck and good desicion making therfor id go and still prefer mining. id also\xc2\xa0 love mining because i can leave it running without the need to monitor it all day and i can still then earn income passively while doing any other jobs outside not unlike trading that requires much human supervision in order to monitor the market frequently to be able to trade and make a profit.'
p193
aS"Quote from: kuronokishi10 on November 20, 2017, 05:26:25 PMFor me both are okay. Mining is good if your personal computer is quick to generate hashes to have mine more bitcoin. Because if your personal computer is so slow,\xc2\xa0 it is better not to do mining because you cannot earn. In trading, it is also good because most of the time if you will just analyze everything before you trade, there's a big possibility that you can really earn big from it. But it also depending on the way you analyze when you do trading with other bitcoin earners or investors. "
p194
aS'For me, i would prefer mining, because in mining you can get much more money because in mining if you have many computers you can get much more money by just investing your money for computers. But in trading the value is changing because it depends on supply and demand. '
p195
aS"Trading is time intensive, mining isn't. Trading can be a lot more rewarding than mining but has a big risk too, an alternative to trading is as said before just holding, but dont just buy at anytime, have patience for a good entry point"

p198
aS'for me it is better to just have a mining rig itself and trade some tokens or coin while doing it  did you get it. you can actually work into both because they are not the opposite i mean both of them are really such an profitable right  '
p199
aS'Not having experience of mining what I have observed is mining need huge investment. So I will prefer trading as we have big opportunities to gain through trading with less investment which is affordable by most of investors. In mining it is not possible. '
p200
aS'Both of them require you to have some skill. Mining on one side is much of technical job which has to do with tech geekyness while trading is analytical job where you have to spend hours watching graphs and understanding trends. My personal favorite will be trading ofcourse. Mining requires a lot of hardware setup while trading can be done with minimal capital. '
p201
aS'Actually, I prefer mining than trading. Because you wont have to do anything. The PC will help you get money. However, I dont have money to buy a strong PC system. Therefore, I just trade to earn profit'

aS'both are important for bitcoin'
p203
aS'I am more suited to trading .. because I do not have a set of computers for mining specifications .. although mining is so promising results.'
p204
aS'Trading and mining is 2 sides of the same coin, most of the coins need a healthy network for it to be a desired coin thus traders interested to buy and sell it'
p205
aS'Both options are up to date. If you are a miners with low power, you can mining coins at the beginning of a new coin and then sell them with profit in exchange. It does not always apply, because some coins will not even get to the exchange. You have to choose well. Another option is to buy cheaply when gets on the exchange and wait for the pump and sell with a profit. For me it is also possible to hold a certain amount of coins for a long time and sell them for a few months.'
p206
aS'Quote from: THAHIRHAJI on December 22, 2017, 05:25:49 PMMining does not require a much heavy investment, it only require the undivided attention and plenty of time, but that is not suggested or recommended for the starters. In my opinion, starters must start with signature campaigns to get the grip on the market and after that they can invest their own money to make use of those instincts they have developed over a period of time. After that if you want to do it on full time job, then select the mining.'
p207
aS'Why not do both? Why limit yourself?'
p208
aS'I think it is better to start trading than mining. Trading is the best way to earn money using cryptocurrencies and to earn more bitcoins to invest. Trading is more productive today because the value of bitcoin is too high and in mining , you can only earn a small amount of coins in a day.'
p209
aS'Quote from: kuronokishi10 on November 20, 2017, 05:26:25 PMBoth. Why not mine while you trade? So long as you are able to multi-task and familiar with the trend for the coin, no problem and more profit. '

aS"Quote from: copoyes on November 20, 2017, 07:50:50 PMIn mining, it does not require any investment, just internet and gadget use for mining but I prefer trading too, eventhough i haven't tried it yet. I think in trading, I can easily and fast earn bitcoin rather than mining.I used to mine bitcoin before, but it takes so much time to meet the minimum withdrawal. Actually, I never had any earning from it that is why I stopped. My phone battery is easy to get low. It is energy consuming."
p211
aS'Quote from: spadormie on December 19, 2017, 03:51:07 PMBoth are difficult jobs especially mining and it is also very costly because mining consumes very high electricity and electricity expenses are too high and experience is must. There are many other things needed for mining. On the other hand trading is quite easy and one can understand trading techniques easily. No extra charges for trading like a big place, electricity o anything else. For me I will choose trading.'
p212
aS'Quote from: Magister Magus on December 22, 2017, 12:18:38 AMIt is not like mining is not profitable, but the only thing is that if you really want to mine, it is better to do it well and that does not come with some little capital. Also, as long as you have some pretty good place where electricity fee is not an issue, then you can really do well making some good profit.It is learnable and there are so many resources to get anyone started once the capital is there. Trading is actually risky but if you learn as well, it is something you can even make huge money with the crazy market.'
p213
aS"Quote from: stefany101 on December 23, 2017, 01:31:06 AMMining is also profitable especially if the price of bitcoin is high because that would give miners big value of the miner's fee they will get. Everyone has their own preference, most might start trading because the requirement is not that high but there are people who can afford to start with a big capital to have a good mining rigs, so I guess it's depending on our financial capacity and our passion in the cryptoworld."

p216
aS'Quote from: rodskee on December 22, 2017, 06:48:18 AMYeah, they are just like totally two different levels of investment and if miners have not really been making some good profit, there is absolutely no way miners would not have just wrapped it up by now and call it quit.It is actually easy when you have the a good electricity rate, a good space with a very nice weather condition, then the only thing is just for the money to keep rolling in without stress. Trading requires some huge learning and work to do, but it can be a highly profitable one.'
p217
aS'Quote from: justdimin on December 23, 2017, 03:34:06 PMThey are really entirely different considering on the price or money needed on such investment since we do know on mining it do really need huge capital since we do know miners arent that cheap which if you decide to engage on this investment then your pocket must really be ready to spend thousands of dollars for you to start out unlike on trading which do not really necessary to start out big.'

aS"Quote from: Tactical Genius on December 24, 2017, 12:33:55 AMFor me trading is better too, I can't even think about mining equipment because of expensive equipment and electricity in my country is very expensive. I have fun with mining some alts with online mining, but just free I will never pay for that.Trading is available for most of us, and thats why I prefer that. I don't need to invest too much and I can so it when I wish. Mining is for people who became very rich with bitcoin and now they can invest in network again, maybe one day I will think more about it and maybe start mining, but who knows what will happen in the future, until then I will trade and make profit from that."
p225
aS'Actually, I am trader forex and stock marketer my experience is five years. Both of trading crypto currency and mining involve starting capital particularly mining bitcoin or altcoins and you need to have a good knowledge about both of them before you invest your capital in any of them.

It may have a expensive price but it may give you back what has been spent and give profit in time. Trading on the other hand is risky through out the process. You do not know what might happen to the price so the best thing to do is either to sell it on a good price or hold it hoping for it to pump more."

aS"Quote from: Yieng7th on December 23, 2017, 03:50:43 PMI would say it's more of a personal decision. Mining doesn't necessarily mean more stability than trading. If you think about it, as price increases - your trading investment increases. So does your mining profit!"
p230
aS'Quote from: Kunlejoe0 on December 23, 2017, 04:33:35 PMI prefer both because both are very profitable for us, so in trading needs low amount of money and mining require high amount of money so trading is better for those people who have no more money and also mining is profitable for those who have money afford its cost.'

If you like analyzing and predicting the price of a currency, get a chance, make a profit, and stop at the right time, then I suggest you do trading. But if you're too scared to take risks, do not like complicated things, and do not like analysis, then you can do holding or mining. Mining, it needs a lot of capital and a strong passion. I myself like mining, but I do not have enough capital, so all I can do is wait and hold. Maybe you're right about the third option."

With mining, there is a good chance of earning around 800-1000 USD worth of bitcoin in a\xc2\xa0 month. That's good extra income if you'll ask me.

aS'Quote from: WinMar on December 19, 2017, 04:49:28 PMThere is no doubt in this thing that trading provides you more profit than mining because mining is very hectic and it takes time to make one transaction whereas trading is related to the increase and decrease in values of coins which is happening all the time in the crypto market. You just need to wait for the best time to buy or sell your coins. Mining is also somehow more professional than trading and cannot be done by every other person. '

You have to have a lot of assets to serve as your bullets to fire for trades, plus you have to find a good platform to trade your coins into. On the other hand, mining is more of a passive way of earning, but you actually need to shed off good capital because of the machinery you need to build in order to mine coins over the interwebs. You also have to consider that it is not as easy now as it way before."
p292
aS"I think the better is trading, because you don't need to spend your time too much in trading even in short period of time only you can earn profit, it needs skills only. Not like in mining you have more patience to wait you can spend too much time and its a long term. Even if there are risk in trading but its better, because it depends on your skills and strategy and its profitable. Both mining and trading are have risky. "

You can start work with it if you can afford to pay this huge electricity bill. This is also not comfortable for all people because we have pay there a huge amount of money too.Trading is a very comfortable for those people who are well known about it.

aS'Mining vs trading always I prefer tradition because I believe a professional traders can make profit 10-20% most of the day where from\xc2\xa0 mining we get a less profit than mining. Mining is for those peoples who are not interested to trade but they want earn for long term basis.'
p301
aS"Trading will certainly be a much more risky activity compared to mining but you can start trading with a much smaller budget than the one you need for mining since you'll need to invest in ASIC miners and setup a rig plus the electricity cost which is just exorbitant . Mining will get you steady incomes that ain't so high and that couldn't meet your expectations but it is a much safer and long time basis investment . Trading might get you to the moon much faster , but might always leave you money-less in no time at all over just one false decision . Investing in these both activities totally depends on the risk you're willing to take over the budget you have ."
p302
aS"Both of them require some amount of investment to be done before starting, I'd personally prefer trading because it just needs a one time investment and if you have some experience then there can a lot of profit that'll you'll make. Whereas in mining, once you invest in the machine you bought for it, you will still have to pay for the electricity bills, and if the mining is not good then there will just be loss. But in trading you just have to be fast and think, that's it! So trading is good over mining as only one time investment is required in mining!"
p303
aS'For me, trade is also better. Although, even because of the fact that if the coin you went into suddenly went wrong, then you can quickly get out of this coin and go into another. But with mining is much more complicated. The equipment has already been bought and you can not jump over much now.'

Also you might end up loosing more by chasing phantoms. I was in Litecoin and Ripple and followed news very closely. However I was still surprised when they suddenly spiked. Unfortunately I traded both of them for other crypto currencies just shortly before they took off, and nobody I know saw this coming either...So I am starting to shift over to mining as it promises more stability and peace of mind.

Mining is just a job for people with a lot of money, profits can be said to be very good in the long run but we need to wait a long time to recover capital, electricity costs, competition is also very much, not everyone has a huge amount of capital and easy success with mining, so I think most will choose trading, it is suitable and easy to work'

If ever we choose trading as good investments, well definitely it has a good advantages with regards to profitable returns on investments.

aS'Quote from: havicvotre on January 06, 2018, 06:51:10 PMThe fact is that at least mining of crypto currency makes sense when you have a good start-up capital, because before it all organizes you need to buy the appropriate equipment and you will have to pay a lot for electricity. At the same time having a minimum of money you can buy certain coins and start trading with them on the stock exchange. As they say first with a small, and get to the Big Income. Thus, I believe that trade is less expensive and more profitable for the user with less funds.'

S"If you want to solo mining bitcoin, this futile attempt unless you have free electricity, but hey it can be profiting if you mine some altcoin, some of them usually new coins with a good fundamental like MUE, have a price about 70-100 sats in the beginning. You don't necessarily need to have your GPU/ASIC ready to mining, there's site like nicehash who provide renting mining power. So if you spot a good coin that you think undervalued, you can take advantage of it. Trading itself is a mental game, how much you beat your own emotion and stick to your plan. Like old people say if the boat gonna sink are you gonna stay within?"

Both of trading crypto currency and mining involve starting capital particularly mining bitcoin or altcoins and you need to have a good knowledge about both of them before you invest your capital in any of them.

p4
aS"Mining could be a decent option if you've got access to cheap electricity and cheap (but good) mining hardware. The initial investment required is enough to turn me off from doing any serious mining, but casually I've made roughly $20 every couple weeks thanks to mining on my computer at work. With some investing savvy, a significantly smaller initial investment can be multiplied many times more much faster."
p5
aS"To trade in altcoins or shares you need to have the feeling for it and also practice a lot, I discourage this for beginners.If you can afford an ASIC miner and also endure the 80dB noise it makes then that's a nice way to earn Bitcoins.But I still think investing and keeping one coin for long term is the best way to generate profit, make sure you keep yourself up-to-dated of latest news about this particular coin.

p7
aS'Honestly, I prefer trading over mining. The later requires a place, strong hardware, time, and so many other stuff, not to mention that the electricity bill is so expensive. Therefore, I need much more money to mine. I do not think mining is meant to be for poor people.On the other hand, trading only requires strategy, some skills, and a knowledge about the market. You can just start your trading journey with only 100$ until you get a good profit.'

aS"Quote from: kuronokishi10 on November 20, 2017, 05:26:25 PMMining only interests me when it comes to coins with low difficulty and low market capitalization that I believe have massive growth potential. ASIC mining has too many barriers to entry for small/casual miners. If I can mine it with my GPU rigs, and I think it has 100x potential, then you can bet that I'm mining it. But in general, I'm more of a trader. Mining is just a hobby, and I'm actually pretty early on the learning curve. I used to play poker heavily, and I found that the analytical/statistics skills I picked up there applied very well to trading. Quote from: kuronokishi10 on November 20, 2017, 05:26:25 PMYou need trading capital to trade. I suggest studying the basics on https://www.babypips.com and then starting with a small account. GPU mining takes overhead and I think it's better to develop a good feel for the altcoin markets before diving into it. But if you fancy yourself more of a longterm investor than a trader, you might find that mining is more up your alley. But unless you have six figures USD to drop into mining, stick to altcoins that you can mine with GPUs.Good luck!"

It may be costly to start up but it is a sure source of passive income. But I will not mine bitcoin because of the difficulty and power consumption. I'll rather mine altcoins and exchange them for bitcoin after.Trading is also profitable but it is not a passive income. It requires dedication and time to make the right trades to make you money."

The only thing that is certain that between the major exchanges, the price of btc in usd will usually fluctuate between 1-15% based on many factors, most of which i have listed above.'

aS'i tottally get the second part of your message, but i am not sure why it would not be profitable to switch marketsFor example moving bitcoin from 1 wallet to other is free, then selling for 1135 sounds way better then for 1070 and buying the same in opposite dirrection.What do you mean exactly by not being profitable? That is the part i did not fully understood.Maybe a short mathematical example would help '
p3
aS'Quote from: Bushuqa on March 17, 2017, 08:48:59 AMIt all comes down to supply and demand on different exchanges.\xc2\xa0 what people are willing to sell it for and what people are willing to buy it for is what dictates the price.\xc2\xa0 '

aS'Quote from: Bushuqa on March 17, 2017, 08:48:59 AMYes, you are most welcome to do so and you can make instant profits by doing this type trading across exchanges. This type of trading is termed as arbitrage trading and people are loving to do this as it will not involve risks as you can make profits by just making buy and sell in quick times (no waiting in between buy and sell).Quote from: Bushuqa on March 17, 2017, 08:48:59 AMBitcoin prices are being determined when people buy/sell it. When one exchange is very much concerned about verification and accommodations, it will have very less volume and hence prices will be moving slowly. That must be the reason cex prices are lagging. You can buy from any exchange where prices are comparatively low.'
p5
aS'Quote from: Bushuqa on March 17, 2017, 09:39:28 AMLike el kaka mentioned, some people do this kind of trading to get profits from the margins quickly, however, buying and selling may incur different fees, add the withdrawal fee and the volatility of the prices to +-100 in short periods of time, by the time you transfer the what you bought from A to B, there are occasional periods where the price at the higher price point would have stabilized. Also probably why people convert to altcoins before hand for even more drastic profit margins'
p6
aS"Quote from: Bushuqa on March 17, 2017, 08:48:59 AMBecause the different volatility of the market will give the different volume and supply. The volatility if the market are making everyone to still buy on that market and not try to buy on the other place with the cheap price. The arbitrage trade is very risky. don't try this at your home. "
p7
aS'Quote from: Bushuqa on March 17, 2017, 08:48:59 AMbecause bitcoin not central priceso every exchanger can difference price, only supply and demand in exchanger can get difference bitcoin pricebitcoin not fix rate price, not regulation if all exchanger must same price'
p8
aS"Quote from: Bushuqa on March 17, 2017, 08:48:59 AMthe reason is always because of the exchange platform and their options.for example poloniex doesn't have a USD market at all, that is an altcoin with the same value as USD called USDT. and also cex.io is a direct fiat deposit and you can use credit cards so they are different.for example btc-e usually has lower prices during volatile times but that is because depositing and withdrawing money has huge fees and that fee always defeats any possibility of making profit from what you are describing which is also known as arbitrage trading."
p9
aS'This is also exist in dollars exchangers and others currencies and this what expert called arbitration. There will ever be different on different exchangers because of volumes, time and place. Many arbitrage traders are taking advantage of it to gug out profit every days.'
p10
aS'Quote from: JeffBrad12 on March 17, 2017, 11:03:48 PMI feel that you might have a strong point in there but i did not fully get the idea, could you offer a concrete mathematical example?I am looking for a BTC is.... on ... market if i .... and ... then ... type of explanation, that would make it clear why is so risky '
p11
aS"Quote from: Idrisu on March 18, 2017, 08:25:36 AMYeah and another thing is that. Different trading platform are not synchronized with each other. Meaning their prices are independent with each other. It varies because the price in every platforms depends on the traders itself. That's why when you compare the prices of a certain coin (or even bitcoin), you can see a slight difference in its price.And as what have been said above some traders took this opportunity to generate profit or a strategy called Arbitration. It is buying at a platfrom with the lowest price then transfer the coin into the platform with the highest selling price."
p12
aS"Quote from: zedicus on March 18, 2017, 10:46:51 AMThats why we can see some arbitrage trader since market price on each trading sites are different from one another and to lucky for the people if they spot a cheap coin on other site and sell on site who's price are bigger, I've lucikily done this for many times and yet try to spot for another coin that gives me another income from it. And also my other conclusion is other sites got different whales support and maybe thats the reason why we can see some downfall on other exchangers."
p13
aS"Quote from: Bushuqa on March 17, 2017, 08:48:59 AMThey're doing it.Of course it's an entire job to do the correct arbitrage.Not as easy as it seems because you have to take into account all the fees and the time needed to do the transfer ^^"
p14
aS'Quote from: valta4065 on March 18, 2017, 11:08:21 AMYes, the time delays to\xc2\xa0 get approved for withdrawal and then network conformations are biggest enemies to kill our plans of doing arbitrage trading. I tried any times to trade across exchanges but got many similar hurdles to throw away myself out of those earning opportunities. Maybe having enough accounts and funds on those exchanges would be a solution here.But usually buying prices in one market would be higher than what seller do offer in another exchanges. So arbitrage opportunities are very rare and being ready with funds across exchanges are not feasible for many traders.The prices gaps across exchanges are usually convergences in quick time usually.'
p15
aS'Quote from: Bushuqa on March 17, 2017, 08:48:59 AMYou have taken example when bitcoin price was dumping really hard so difference look huge at that time. But if you look right now, difference is of only few $ and there will be always some difference in price between different exchanges due to lots of factor like the payment processor they support for deposit/withdrawal, trading fees, fees on deposit/withdrawal, number of active traders and daily trading volume in those exchanges etc. '
p16
aS'Quote from: Bushuqa on March 18, 2017, 10:34:28 AMFor a simple person in simple words I will say that different exchanges show different prices because of the crowd on different exchanges. Suppose on one exchanges there are many people to buy bitcoins and the sellers find that they can easily sell at high price so the price at that exchange increases while in others where the buyers are not much in number the sellers try to keep lower in order to get some buyers. '
p17
aS'because each exchange has a user that is different. anybody can perform different actions. This makes different prices. usually an exchange that has a lot of users will have a competitive price.'
p18
aS'Interestingly enough, they all have their own marketplace software. So, the person who sells bitcoin on one exchange for altcoin, is not exchanging it on another at the same time. You get to do it only on one exchange. Meaning the highest volume exchange will have less risk and less volatility. Tough the one that starts new and has low volume might be more open to speculation and prices will change quickly depending on the people.'
p19
aS"Quote from: Bushuqa on March 18, 2017, 10:34:28 AMArbitrage bitcoin is risky, besides the fluctuation and volume, you need to consider transaction speed, it's very necessary if you want to do arbitrage.You said transfer amount of btc is free.. No, exchange charge the fees too. Although the fees is near free compared with other payment processor.I think altcoin is good to trade arbitrage, because typically more fast."
p20
aS"Each website has it's users. For someone one website is good to use with it's interface and etc, for someone - second. Also there are many factors and that's normal, price difference means it is decentralized and as everyone knows, such difference in bitcoin price excist because of previous reason.Well, to my mind that's because there is no official global bitcoin price."
p21
aS"Quote from: shield132 on March 18, 2017, 10:32:33 PMBitcoin has a global price since its price depends on the various trading site such as BTCC, Bittrex, Okcoin, and etc. Its price rely on the sell order and buy order for each site. As sell orders are more than buy orders, then that's the time bitcoin's price would go down. Bitcoin is decentrelized currency that its rate is upon its users demand and supply, same as forex."
p22
aS'When there is no law, regulations telling exchanges to set their prices properly, this shows the true decentralization of cryptocurrencies.Even if you see $1170 on an exchange how many coins can you sell or buy with exact amount? '
p23
aS"Quote from: digaran on March 19, 2017, 03:44:59 AMThat is right, each exchange fixes their own rate according to their demand and supply but their computers endeavors to sync their prices, which is one reason those wild disparities doesn't stay long. There are some traders that actually set out to hunt for these disparity and exploit them. The use of software makes it less stressful and quicker to spot and respond to. So next time you spot such differences in price and the fee are not disagreeable, go ahead and make some coins out of the situation - network speed permitting."
p24
aS'Quote from: Bushuqa on March 17, 2017, 08:48:59 AMIt\'s because there is no regulation and there\'s no regulator or body of international government that monitor bitcoin exchanges price. If you are familiar with "suggested retail price" for products in supermarkets. The same thing is bitcoin exchanges, since there is no suggest bitcoin price. An exchange can adjust the amount that they desire.'
p25
aS'This is nothing but mis-pricing of security, in theory of efficient market hypothesis EMH by Eugene Fama, an asset price incorporate all the available information and will be trading at fair value.In reality, we are not part of perfect market, most of the markets worldwide are semi-strong efficient. What it means is, the new information takes a while to get reflected in the price. whereas in perfect market (strong form of efficiency) stock price reflects as soon as some information is made available.To link this to your question, it may happen that the investors in different stock exchanges may be not aware of the exact information leading to different pricing of same security in two different markets.It may also happen that as the prices of a security is derived from actual transactions, availability of buyer and seller also be a reason. A higher liquid market absorbs the information faster than relatively illiquid market.Happy Investing!!!'
p26
aS"1) Front-running. It used to be rife on the mainstream stock exchanges until they made it illegal.\xc2\xa0 Front-running is where you know what your client will do next and you trade before him, knowing that his later trade will change the price in your favour.The exchanges know how much cash their clients hold.\xc2\xa0 They also have power over how long it takes before they credit you with the dollars you just sent to the exchange.\xc2\xa0 They say it takes one to eight days.\xc2\xa0 It should be the same value day.\xc2\xa0 They can credit all clients on a Sunday night, knowing the wave of buying will start on Monday morning.Once your coins are on the way to the exchange or already arrived its not worth the time or trouble to move them to another exchange.2) For exactly the same reason as above, most exchanges don't take Tether.\xc2\xa0 If they did, you could instantly arbitrage between exchanges, thus undermining their profits from front-running."
p27
aS'I think the reason behind why there are some differences in prices between the exchange markets is the commission or additional charge that they impose in all transaction. In this way they can earn revenues that will support all of their expenses and the excess will be their income .'
p28
aS'It\xc2\x92s a very nice thinking and it is a very good question. In this online market there are too many exchange but the take a charge different amount, it\xc2\x92s main resin is site capacity and popularity and some website have too many worker so they accept high fees and his service is very useful.\xc2\xa0 '
p29
aS'I think the best reason from this why there are different exchange rates in different markets is because of the mark up cost or the commission that they imputed in this rates. All exchange market companies earn revenues through putting commission in exchange rates. For me this regards the price because the more important is the quality of service they provide in every customer.'
p30
aS"I'm seeing\xc2\xa0 huge price gaps in the same exchange, but different pairs as well, for example in kraken bitcoin price in euros is higher than in USD. This is all due to usd/euro exchange rate or other parameters?"
p31
aS"It is depend on his website and it's depend domain security, some crypto currency site have a best protection as like bittrex, Binance, Poloniex so this site have a different price and different exchange fees and also depend how many worker stay with this company."
p32
aS"Quote from: Quartx on March 17, 2017, 09:26:06 AM\xc2\xa0In addition there is also the difference in the volume of people who trades. It might be a lot greater on this exchange than the other. So if the demand is greater on this exchange then the price will also increase. \xc2\xa0It would be hassle and time consuming if you would buy btc in this exchange and trade it to other exchange. You'll go bankrupt with the price of the transaction fees implemented on each exchange."
p33
aS'Quote from: Bushuqa on March 17, 2017, 08:48:59 AMBecause each exchange market has different trader, different people will place different orders so different prices. The difference between the exchange floor is the reason for the price of Altcoin up or down.'
p34
aS"I think it's good., just choose an exchanger that's already familiar with you and it has been proven can be trusted and you feel comfortable with it.And I think for exchangers that are proven can be trusted and already famous, it certainly will be the most updated about the development of the coins prices and in accordance with the facts."
p35
aS'Actually that is the thing I observed in different exchange market. I think the reason behind of this thing is the commission that they imposed in each transaction. There are some companies that is too much expensive in terms of its services while others are cheaper.'
p36
aS'Quote from: Bushuqa on March 17, 2017, 08:48:59 AMIn each market the number of transactions takes place differently and the amount of money and coins in the exchanges markets is different so prices will vary. in the addition, \xc2\xa0 the price in the exchange are regulated by the trader and depend on the need of buying and selling.

p37
aS"Quote from: Genosx on January 10, 2018, 07:25:11 PMThey're all independent structures and this is normal when you understand they're independent. The price can't follow the same path everywhere because the traders are not the same people everywhere. They're all different traders with different order books. "
p38
aS'I think that a lot of people were doing a lot of arbitrage between the traditional exchanges and the korean exchanges, and they were shut down a few days ago.Maybe you do not care about this, but this is the root of the thread, the korean exchanges were the first example about expensive exchanges, and the traditional ones, the cheap ones.'
