S'A guy contacted me and offered me 1 masternode to design a website for him. He developing a new cryptocurrency at very early stage. The wallets are ready, but still no ANN on bitcointalk. Please give me some advise, what can I do to ensure that I will get paid. Is there any escrow I can use for that servise?Thank you!'
p1
aS'how much reward you can pay i think you must explain about pay rate'
p2
aS'I am the designer. The guy who hired me should pay to me 1 MN of the coin he created for my work. But how to be sure he will not scam me?'
p3
aS'BTC'
p4
aS'He offered a bounty, so the payment will be in the new currency. Is there any kind of escrow I can use? Or how can I check if this is a scam?Thank you for your answers!'
p5
aS'Anybody? Please advise!'
p6
aS'best way is to get him to escrow a set BTC with someone like MinerJones or Lauda, once work is completed and the project is live the owner sends you the coins then the escrow releases the BTC back to the guy. if the guy doesnt come through with the coins then the escrow is released to you. thats the way I would try to structure it.. if they dont have the BTC to escrow why are you doing work for them?'
p7
aS'We still negotiating, but the offer is very good and I would like to accept it, but also don`t want to be scammed.This escrow services you mentioned, would they escrow this new currency? Because they will need to store it on their own wallet IMO.'
p8
aS'After some research maybe I will use the Lauda services. Thank you, TMAIN.I have one more concern: I wanted to look at the code of this new coin and the github activity, but the dev told me the github will be released next week. That sounds a little bit suspicious to me. How to make sure this is really the legit dev?'

aS'In my opinion, this is a best way now. You can look the chart. What happens if you buy Bitcoin in January, 2017 and sell it now? The super big profit you will get.'
p2
aS"personally holding bitcoins is still the best way to do than any other coins. though in long term investment is a little bit risky but if we are talking about only half a year i guess there is nothing to be scared of just don't be so greedy and wait for years for much bigger profits."
p3
aS'holding bitcoin for a long time is certainly the best way to make a profit here because the fixed price keeps going up from year to year although sometimes it goes down but only briefly then rises again so holding bitcoin for a long time is a good investment'
p4
aS"As of today.holding bitcoin for a long term is good because the value of bitcoin as of now is very nice.maybe next month they pump again and maybe in a next few years also.if that time comes you'll see your coin.its to much for you're profits."
p5
aS'In long term, we alrady saw the potential of it. In short term, there are still crysis about the price. But this will be solved once the market get enough participants in the future. The result is that bitcoin is always a good investment.'
p6
aS"It's now 2017, 2 years from the original post and we've gone a long way. The price of btc right now is a testament to its staying and earning power. Congratulations to people who kept the faith and held on to their BTC! "
p7
aS"Yeah, there are a lot of people who already make profit if they do an action on what they are saying. Bitcoin is worth for long term investment and we have proven it already now, I believe this is just a beginning so let's continue to hold."
p8
aS"Of course, people who HODL BTC early 2017's\xc2\xa0 they already have maybe a 10000% profit. which is amazing you can buy a brand new mustang with that!"
p9
aS"Definitely it's a big yes that holding bitcoin for a long time is good way to make money, that was very good idea, because we all know that the price of bitcoin is not decreasing but it is increasing and increasing day by day, so if we will hold our bitcoin in long time we will be gauranteed to make many from it."
p10
aS'Need to hold atleast couple years...10 times better price will be.. '
p11
aS"That price has increase but it's still depending on how much you invested. It's easy to say now because we have already seen what happen, now if we really believe in bitcoin, we can buy now with this price and just hold for 10 years, there is no limit of price increase so we can make profit for sure once bitcoin will continue to survive."
p12
aS'As long as it does not burden you, it is a great way. I mean, if you can still meet your daily needs then bitcoin holding is a good store for the future. It will not matter if you focus too much on holding bitcoins and ignoring your everyday needs. Daily necessities still have to be top priority.'
p13
aS'In my own opinion Holding Bitcoin for a long time is a good way to make money because long time holding has the the strong possibilities earn a big profit. If we had invested earlier years back we already earned more profit than we expected since Bitcoin is in demand today the value will continue to grow so better hold it.'
p14
aS'Yeah i definitely would say that it is the best these days, but damn i regret the bitcoins i lost 3 years ago lmao, i had 10 btc and i forgot where i put it xD'
p15
aS'Holding bitcoin a long time is a good way to make money because eventually bitcoin will go up by a big percentage as it gets bigger and more users. It can take some and you have to be patient, best is to safe up as much bitcoin as possible before it happens.'
p16
aS'Most of the times, you need to do some extra work in order to get something big in our lives. You need to make an analysis of the market price of the bitcoin since the time it was introduced to this world. In addition to this, you also need to have a chart analysis in order to predict the future price of bitcoin. All these things will give you a very clear picture of whether or not you should hold your bitcoins.'
p17
aS'Yes, holding Bitcoin for a long time is indeed a good way to make money. The price of Bitcoin was just $350 a year ago. It is now around $11,000. So, if you hold Bitcoin for a year or two, you would definitely get rich.'
p18
aS'This is a good way to make money from bitcoin but you have to buy it with low value and hold an average length of 1-2 months.'
p19
aS'lenght of 1 to 2 months is good but long term of 6 to 1 year if your can is better , holding bitcoin for me is also investment so if you hold bitcoin for 6 to 1 year time frame youll be going to have a good profit it also depends on how much bitcoin you hold the more you hold the more you earn profit.'

aS'My own answer to this is YES because it has been generally agreed that bitcoin is a digital gold even when the price falls be sure that it will rise again.'
p2
aS"\xc2\xa0Yeah that's jus' Ludacris."
p3
aS"This is just my opinion. If you have a bit of cash YOU DO NOT NEED for anything putting it into BTC has a good chance for the long term. it's in the Early Adopter phase now, but if it gets to the next stage then zoom, Yes it will go up big time. Nothing is certain. Which is why you only use money you don't need and also that you would NOT feel bad if things went wrong and you lost it. (It's about knowing who you are and what is comfortable)If you don't like the idea of your money sitting around doing nothing while its sitting in Bitcoin form\xc2\xa0 you could try a service like BTCJam.com or FirstGlobalCredit.com. Both of those take bitcoins for investments and I THINK both deliver profits in bitcoins. They are very different services. BTCJam gives loans to people and businesses. FGC lets you use BTC as margin to trade stocks like Google, Facebook, Gold and stuff.AP!"

aS"Got more question on this.\xc2\xa0 So i got bitcoin when it was around $270.\xc2\xa0 I just decide to hold on to it instead of trading it for poker money or bank money.\xc2\xa0 The reason is because my thought is bitcoin will always go up so once i sell it, say after a long time it goes up to say 500 dollars... let say i sold 30 btc around the time for like $8100.\xc2\xa0 Then once it hits 500 dollars... then i would tell myself it would have been worth $15000 if i kept it and would made $6900 minus the 1 percent fee etc.I also requested more bitcoin recently from sites.\xc2\xa0 However bitcoin has dropped all the way down to 227 dollars at the moment.\xc2\xa0 So since holding those bitcoin at 270... i lost quite a bit due to the btc fluctuations.\xc2\xa0 However if i sell it right now, then once btc goes back up, then i would feel silly for selling it.\xc2\xa0 So what is the right plan of action?\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right now what i would like is for btc to go back up to say 250 then i would sell it then take breakeven if you know what i mean.\xc2\xa0 My thoughts from what i read about bitcoin is it will only go up... however at what point should i start worrying?\xc2\xa0 When bitcoin goes down to say 175?\xc2\xa0 I would take a big loss if i sell it at then and then once it goes back up to say 250... then i would feel silly.Is my logic right or wrong that selling btc is not profitable since in the long run btc will always go up... its best to not sell any of it?\xc2\xa0 That has been my thinking since i read many ppl say bitcoin price will only go up.\xc2\xa0 However when i look at btc price everyday and its dropping so much, i been telling myself why didn't i just sell it once i got the btc if you know what i mean.\xc2\xa0 Would like if someone could give me a detailed response to this."
p5
aS'I understand what you are feeling right now. And your concern is also right. But this price drop is for short term and also temporary, so keep your Bitcoins with you and after an year or two you will get your money back along with some profit too. '
p6
aS"At what point would you say one should worry about bitcoin?\xc2\xa0 Such as what if it drops all the way to say $150?\xc2\xa0 Would that be the time to just sell it all back or that would be foolish?\xc2\xa0 Would you say since i don't like the way btc price is going, just sell them all once the price gets to around $250 so i don't have much of a loss or win?\xc2\xa0 I got most of my bitcoin when price was around 230-270 dollars though most of it was from 250-270.\xc2\xa0 I recalled at one point it went to 300.So basically when i first got bitcoin like at 220 price, i sold some off at 235 or so for a small profit.\xc2\xa0 Then later on acquired more bitcoins when price got higher but then kept most of those bitcoins and well btc price now is 225.\xc2\xa0 Another question i have is this.\xc2\xa0 How do you calculate profit/loss on bitcoins when you factor getting lot of bitcoins throughout?\xc2\xa0 Example i still have around 5 btc in my bitcoin wallet where it was around 220 dollars or so.\xc2\xa0 Then i requested say 20 btc and that is when it was around 258, then got some 10 btc when it was around 280... then recently got around 20 btc that is around 228.\xc2\xa0 So let say this, i got 10 btc now where price is 225 each so 2250 total.\xc2\xa0 If i sell 10 btc and assuming price is similar, then i won't have any net loss at all.\xc2\xa0 That is my logic but the thing im wondering is well are those same 10 btc i sell... couldn't i say hey those are the 10 btc i got much earlier?\xc2\xa0 However that logic would be wrong right?\xc2\xa0 Does that make sense in what im saying?\xc2\xa0 Example say i want to get rid of 5 btc.\xc2\xa0 Let say i got 5 btc at 225 each so 1125 total.\xc2\xa0 I also have around 5btc that i got much earlier when it was 220... then i have a bunch of btc when price was 280 and 258.\xc2\xa0 But if i get rid of 5btc once i got 5btc, then those 5btc are the same ones i just got recently right?\xc2\xa0 So even if i get rid of 5 btc from a different btc address, its basically well the same 5btc i just received from a site?The accounting of recording bitcoin loss/profit seem a bit confusing to me because when you sell btc... which btc are you actually selling?\xc2\xa0 The ones you receive recently or the ones you kept not long ago or the btc from when you first got it? "
p7
aS'History has shown that yes and no, there is no way to know what bitcoin will be in a long time, you can\xc2\xb4t know even at short times, bitcoin is extremely volatile and anyone who claims to know what the price will be in x time is lying, specially with altcoins that are even more volatile.'
p8
aS'What you said is correct. I think instead of holding btc for long time buy and sell when you make a some decent profit is a good strategy. You can do this process to reduce your losses. If some one follow your strategy and if they hold btc from 1000 + until now means they are in a big loss so when you see some sudden fall in price it is better to sell and take that small loss and wait for the next entry. '
p9
aS'hold on to them for 10 years, the supply will stop at 21million and continue to diminish as bitcoins are lost.'
p10
aS'Hey OP, do you happen to play on the Minecraft server BitQuest? Your name looks familiar.And to answer your recent post, it really depends on your faith as to what price would be the "death" mark for Bitcoin. Personally, I would sell all my coins if the price dropped below $150 and wait out whatever catastrophic event has taken place. If Bitcoin doesn\'t die from such an event, you can always buy your coins back for much less when the price rebounds, and if it doesn\'t... well it\'s a good thing if you aren\'t invested once that happens.'
p11
aS'not necessarily because we do not know whether bitcoin will rise or fall. and it can not be predicted'
p12
aS"Your best move is to spend some money you have no use to. Buy bitcoins, store them in a safe way, and forget about them for a good amount of time. Otherwise you just are going to get anxious and sell them when you 'think the price is high enough'"
p13
aS"i do believe that holding bitcoins for the long term will give you a great reward eventually. you only need to make sure you have the patience for it. and also, don't panic if the price is going down hard. use that situation in your advantage to buy even more coins if you can."

S"I first got bitcoin from withdrawing from gambling sites.\xc2\xa0 I deposited with another method but could withdraw bitcoin so i did it.\xc2\xa0 Around that time bitcoin was around $220 usd or so and when i got it, i would then trade it for poker funds from other person etc because I didn't want to hold the bitcoins due to reading about price fluctuations.\xc2\xa0 However, isn't the value of bitcoin almost always going to go up so its best to hold it?\xc2\xa0 I know last year it was $600 and the highest was when it was more than $1000 per bitcoin.\xc2\xa0 But since it is all the way down to $200-$300, isn't having bitcoin always good?\xc2\xa0 Could bitcoin go all the way to 0 soon?\xc2\xa0 I had thought hey if you get bitcoin when its $230 when the price stayed like that for a long time, thats great b/c very hard for it to go below $200 because i haven't seen that.\xc2\xa0 But even if it does, isn't it almost always going to rebound and go back up?\xc2\xa0 Last time i had btc and it was $230 or so and now it went up to $260.\xc2\xa0 So if you have say 100 bitcoins... well... thats a nice $3000 profit or so.I'm sure there are ppl that have thousands or bitcoins right and just hold on to it?\xc2\xa0 And many that would sell btc immediately if prices go all the way up?\xc2\xa0 If someone had say 500 bitcoin... then btc price went up $20 in say a week or so... selling it would net them $10000 minus fees right?\xc2\xa0 However if they sell it via localbitcoins or other method, they are going to get a higher profit right?\xc2\xa0 However if they do this, say sold all their 500 btc... then once bitcoin later in the year go up another $50... well that would be $25000 less they would have earned.In general, isn't holding BTC always a good thing since the price of it is pretty low now?\xc2\xa0 Obviously if you bought btc at $600 or $1000 and thought it would went up and held on to your btc, that would been a disaster.\xc2\xa0 But since its in the $200-$300 range, isn't having BTC always good?"
p1
aS"you're indeed right, bitcoin feel much less risky now than when it was at 600-1200, and not only because the price is lower, but especially because we are in this range for a very long time, this is what you should look aboutthe more we stay in this range the more this floor will be consolidated, and the more hard will be to decline under ita slowly rise like this could permit to build solid floors while we rise, instead when you have a tremendous pump like that of 1200, you should ALWAYS foresee a crash with an equal power"
p2
aS'As the current market rates fluctuates daily but as on weekends they fluctuates about 15dollars\xc2\xa0 so you can flip your bitcoins at weekends.And, no holding your bitcoins for long is not a very good idea, you can trade them for other altcoins and then trade them back to btc after their incereased value, basically buy low and sell high.'
p3
aS'Yes because the price sky rockets from time to time. '
p4
aS"Yes like yesterday but it soon followed a down trend after it, and the op isn't asking about these short term jumps. Over the long term it primarily depends on adoption . Its hard to say it will be a safe investment, but its pure speculation based on the fact that bitcoin is the best answer towards decentralization and there fore should be the likely outcome. But if the adoption doesn't happen and it doesn't come to that phase, it will mean it won't rise in price and could over time fall down to around 100. "
p5
aS"i think so risky if you Holding bitcoin a long time\xc2\xa0 , may be just 3-6 Month it's good . but , if you already got cheap or profit you should sell your bitcoin , and waiting dump again ."
p6
aS'No doubt, hold bitcoin start from now is a good invest way!'
p7
aS"In theory it should being a deflationary currency, but it all depends on supply and demand. Again, in theory the halving should push the value up but that also depends on what the demand for coins is like. It could go to zero or less than $100 but probably wont anytime soon and hopefully never.The price is very low and bitcoin hasn't reached even a small percentage of it's potential so the potential for it to rise dramatically or go back to around $1000 is very good in my opinion though we may need patience."
p8
aS"most definitely, yes. compared to other investments bitcoin has way more room for great profits. but the only thing is that most people can't hold their coins for long. as soon as they see the price increased with 50%, they will sell."
p9
aS'Put some in coldstorage. But for Bitcoin to succeed I also think you should use them, to buy, trade etc.'
p10
aS'Holding bitcoin for long term is good but you need to have some eye on board also because its giving good profit on short term basis also as happen few days back some bump and now again prices going on regular rate'
p11
aS"Allocate some to buy and spend. If they all just sit there doing nothing then I'm not so sure it'll get anywhere. The philosophy of holding has taken something of a battering over the last 18 or so months. If you believe in BTC as a concept then a significant rise needs to happen for it to take hold. At the same time you need to keep your wits about you for potential death spirals. It's far from being in the bag yet. "
p12
aS'Holding bitcoin is like holding other investments such as stocks or gold. Is holding stocks always good? Apple was at $200 in 2010, it was $600 in 2014 before the stock split. There were ups and downs during those 4 years, it also peaked at $670 in 2012. Knowing when to buy and when to hold is whats makes it "good".Bitcoin peaked at over $1000 and now it is around $250. If you think bitcoin has the potential to pass $1000 again, isn\'t buying at $400 and $300 still very "good"?'
p13
aS"It should be a good investment, and I am fairly confident it will.But nobody can truly predict the market and know what will happen next with the price, and Bitcoin is know to be volatile.So yes, Bitcoin is a solid investment, but don't put your whole net worth into it."
p14
aS"It's most likely a good investment. You just have to compare pros and cons. The main reason for buying should be the fact that it is a great technology and even its haters confirm it. The world is just not ready for it yet. Also, it has reached a confirmed bottom in January and bounced back to somewhat stable price of $200. Most predictions say it will keep going up."
p15
aS"I agree with you, holding btc for a long time might make you a huge amount of profit instantly if it goes up. But I wouldn't personally do that myself because I don't depend on miracles like that anymore. The time has passed, this ain't no 2 years go. The price went up yesterday but only by $10-15 dollars. Waiting for bitcoin to pass $1000 again is just ludacris to me. But I believe there's still a chance for btc to increase in it's value as more people use it, and look at Greece, for ex. online PayPal has been banned, this is a good chance for btc. "
p16
aS"Holding will likely make you the most money in the long term but obviously nothing in the short term. I believe in 2-5 years bitcoin will be worth multiples of what it is now so I think it'd be wise to save, but in the meantime you could try trading for profit. Risky to do this though."
p17
aS"It's only a good way if you are buying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BTC and holding it so that you can control enough market share to set the price, rather than the fucking assholes who are dumping BTC and keeping the price artificially, bullshit low."
p18
aS'Which gambling sites are you referring to? They all have abandoned the idea. The gambling sites which are truly licensed i mean.'
p19
aS"I've been researching it and I do think it's a good long-term investment strategy, especially at the current levels.\xc2\xa0 I bought my first Bitcoins today.\xc2\xa0 I've been trading stocks/options for awhile but I'm starting to invest in Bitcoins.\xc2\xa0 Now that Wall Street has validated the existence of Bitcoins with the launch of a Bitcoin ETF, I think more people/companies will validate and use it.The volume of buying/selling is continuing to increase every month.\xc2\xa0 Yes, there will be price fluctuations with the prices (but so does stocks), I think Bitcoins is a great long-term investment.\xc2\xa0 "

p2
aS'Congratulations with hiting 1 million. You did buy all these coins in right time, before big money came in crypto. Do someone wanna try to do same challenge but with market cap as it is now?  '
p3
aS'It still possible. I know an effective way. You should invest in ICO which the developer is thrusted. Many altcoin which the price is increase after the ICO end. Even some coin price is rise more than 1000%. XRP, XCPO and\xc2\xa0 some other new Altcoin are success. '
p4
aS"Wow, congrats on reaching that 1 million goal within 8 months man. If I saw this post back in May, I would've totally doubted it, but now I'm seriously impressed. "
p5
aS'HR , you nailed it bro .all your coins you chose for investment are now rise too much .. all the best hope you will convert those 1m into 50-100 million this year\xc2\xa0 '
p6
aS'add a bunch of deeponion too and your good '
p7
aS'I like deeponion , currently dont have any funds , need to sort out few things . But in Future i will definetly buy some  One day gonna be big'

aS'I hope that he passed the target already, Congrats. If xrp was in that portfolio he would be heading to $2mm. Lots of people who started with same portfolio did make the $mm in Dec. Congrats again.'
p14
aS'It is not impossible though because of the volatility of all the coins and knowing that the altcoins are starting to make their way to the top this year because a lot of people are saying that some altcoins are now going to be bigger than bitcoins and that is a great thing to start investing to them. And as i can see on how you diversify you money it is great because litecoins are doing great too these year so i hope that those 10k will be 1m in the future it will just take years or maybe less we cannot predict it accurately.'
p15
aS'I think the quickest way to market Crypto so that you can increase your capital is to invest in new altcoin instead of co-investing in bitcoin. You may find that bitcoin investment is safer but it can not increase your money many times.'
p16
aS'In someone wants to earn good profits from investing in crypto currency, he must understand the future of these coins first. They are just getting started, specially Bitcoin and some of the famous alternative coins Like Ethereum, ripple, Monero, Litecoin and the list goes on. Someone who is a holder of any one of them should wait and hold these for at least 2 more years. Being carried away from the present profit is easy but just imagine the future values. '
p17
aS'You were insanely right!'
p18
aS'God.. that is pretty difficult if you do not even\xc2\xa0 know what the hell you are doing in there.No offense, but $10k in one million is something that is pretty difficult, and specially if you are not investing in ICOs, because they can give you much more profits in a long term.'

S"Getting dumped? Can you guys read the ticker? The portfolio is off the lows. The dump happened before the buy. Positions are best put on in the midst of panic sells, and that's when this position was put on and recommended. In fact, I think the probabilities of getting a second chance at the purchase price of each issue is very low, but anything can happen, and any off the cuff comment can always get lucky, so don't lose heart - there might be another opportunity for you to troll and with even better ammo. \xc2\xa0"
p1
aS'Haha this is hilarious. Omg. "Medium risk" in the same sentence as altcoins. So this is a balanced portfolio to you? So basically you don\'t understand investments at all. Good to know. Won\'t be watching this. This is speculative 100% growth very very high risk. Medium risk means you\'re holding some bonds and some good stocks with real potential. These are shitcoins. Good thing you have 50% in Litecoins. At least you\'ll have something when these all go to 0.'
p2
aS'i dont think litecoin will go to zero. its still being traded on largest exchanges with very big volume.'
p3
aS'That\'s why "medium risk" is in quotation marks. The context is crypto, not stocks and bonds. It\'s a relative statement. Of course, when you say this is "very very high risk" and you refer to them as "shitcoins", you do give the impression that you are aware of the difference. So why the confusion on your part? Why are you mixing two very different worlds? '
p4
aS"100x increase is a tad lot and you may lost all of it if you became very greedy but again, long-term hodling is the biggest no-brainer when it comes to investments since there will be times when it will be doing massive rounds of bullish movements. As long as you have them altcoins, you have your money and as long as you haven't sold them, you won't lose anything.Best of luck!"
p5
aS' Was going to ask what your rule of engagement or entry and exit hinges on and what actually influenced your choice of those coins, but on reading the above, it gave me the clue you are not groping in the dark. Your quest is accomplishable, if you have not already set everything on stone, because adjustments and outright changes would be necessary as time goes on.'
p6
aS"From that list, the only crypto in which I would put some money would be Litecoin. I like it when a project tries to innovate, but from what I've seen so far, most of these coins are perpetual motion machines."
p7
aS'This is one of the most promising alternative coins to date. Maybe it makes sense to buy this coin today. I also think about it.Even despite the fact that until recently, I trusted only bitcoin'
p8
aS'As my philosophy says that cryptocurrency market is so unpredictable. But after the deep knowledge of altcoins market price last few days all coins were improved. Turn $10,000 into 1 Million obviously hard job, need pure luck. However, I hope your wish come true.'
p9
aS'Its not imposible that 1OOOO$ turn to 1million.Because of many traders now of BTC and the promotion of bitcoins now is to be the highest rate of promotions.'
p10
aS'Please elaborate how they are scam?'
p11
aS'I am sure we will be able to see a rally in Litecoin in the coming weeks as it did not perform as i would have imagined after the activation of segwit and so i am still holding some coins thinking that it could give me a good profit in the coming months.@OP if your entry is good then you are good to go to reach the desired target,good luck.'
p12
aS'litecoin as the oldest altcoin that we know have a good journey so far and many of people still holding big amount of litecoin and they only waited for the high price. maybe some of them is selling their litecoin to see what is reaction that will happen in the markets. so far, litecoin is going to strong and litecoins is one of the sleeping giants altcoin that will wake up soon.'
p13
aS'Yea I second this'
p14
aS'I think the your best bet to turn 10,000 into 1mil is to go all in on an altcoin that shows a lot of potential and buy in early. hold it until the price 100x like ripple. Trading will take too long and is too hard to do.'
p15
aS"Why there is no ETH and or ETC? I think ETH will be around 600 this year and ETC around 50... don't you think so? what are your thoughts?"
p16
aS'Portfolio Trend-Momentum AnalysisSTEEM is perhaps my favorite with its strong price reaction to the golden cross and bullish alignment of moving averages on a daily time frame. Strong volume based momentum that looks steady even while clearly being in a corrective phase.Nxt also got a similar shot in the arm with its own golden cross and bullish moving average alignment \xc2\x96 the 50dma looks to be providing critical support and money flow is ticking up. Got a little overdone, but not lethal. BitShares got a bit away from the mean, but has come back in and the overall configuration is positive.Syscoin has been correcting by drifting higher for the past month. Very positive and sustainable looking chart to me.Litecoin has been correcting for a while now without the money flow going oversold (and turning back up now) and the MACD in zero line territory. The moving averages are in bullish alignment which has obviously had a positive effect on price. Consolidating with very a positive volume pattern I see something that is setup to explode higher. NEM has followed a similar stair stepping pattern (no parabolic curves) riding up the bullish configured moving averages in stainable fashion currently working off excesses.PIVX is an early cycle performer and, as such, should be an interesting watch. The price action around the upsloping moving averages is very encouraging to see. The Williams %R upthrust combined with bullish buy signals on the MACD are confirmation of a very possible resumption to the upside. This would also be a good sign for Alts in general - not so good for BTC though. \xc2\xa0All positive looking charts from a trend-momentum standpoint, especially when put alongside something fairly overextended like DigiByte (who is mentioned here not only as an example of something having got a bit ahead of itself, but also as a potential buy candidate at lower levels).And what does BTC look like through these bifocals? I\xc2\x92ll leave it up to you. Looks extremely bullish to me.  Short term it could be bounded by 1750 and 2350 though.'
p17
aS'I would like to see how your investment growing, as trading altcoins is not for long term I guess where it could dump and never arise again.However, turn $10,000 into $1Million maybe take months or even years due to competition that happened there cause profit and loss as well.did you invest all $10,000 just into those coins? and How long do you think your goal will be achieved?'
p18
aS'You would have to be extremely lucky and buy an altcoin which shoots up multiple times its original value to turn 10,000 into 1mil. It might be possible to do it through trading but it will be challenging and will take some time, not to mention you have to be a good trader to do it'
p19
aS'Buy a new altcoin and hold it until it blows up. thats your best bet to turn 10000 into 1mil. If you had bought Ripple 2 months ago you would have 1mil by now.'

aS"What's this? A self challenge? 10k usd to 1M is very possible. You just need a precise buy and sell judgement. Please update this thread of your progress."
p2
aS'Although it is possible, but it is a very difficult road. Need great luck, and great ability. Well, even with $ 1000 you can do it, with bitcoin, you can achieve whatever target you want, but it takes a very hard effort.'
p3
aS"I think that it is a bad time to invest in any of those as the peak was reached and now massive profit taking it taking place. There's only so long bagholders will be hodling for. There are tons of coins to be dumped and aside of the bubble, no market to absorb them."
p4
aS'I did not understand you completely but what I learnt from your post is you want to make x percentage of your shares everywhere in the top altcoins and they you will wait for the price to pump high. This will generate huge amount of profits for you in the future. Is it like that?'
p5
aS"Oh my. When the massive altcoin bubble pops you'll be back to square one. I hope your portfolio also includes bitcoins but you just didn't include that as this is your altcoin portfolio."
p6
aS"I'm happy to see that you have so much fait in Litecoin (I do too). I wish you the best of luck and I think if you're able to control your emotions you should be able to pull it off. But make sure you give it time, and even if things look bad HODL!!"
p7
aS"Can't applied this to NEM. This project is meant for long term and surely it will passed their recent ATH to far more that a long time holders can't really imagined. That's why I putting money in some event that the price are on dipping status (like this past days until now).I have been in NEM since the price was below 1,000 satoshis. After almost year of holding, I see some surprised with this. The 5,000 satoshis back then is the target and considered as high price but now it's sees as a cheap price."

p9
aS"The only way that gain is realistic now is with coins that are presently effectively dead, or almost completely unknown, and for them to go stratospheric. That's very possible but none of those coins fit the bill.You'll probably do very well eventually but you need to place some wilder bets and forget about them for the really dramatic increases. \xc2\xa0"

If everyday making 100% (= $10k) profits then it might take more than 3 months time and for 10% (a reasonable) daily profits it would take three and half years. But daily $1000 profits still seems impractical to me.'
p14
aS'Lots of great replies and comments. I\xc2\x92ll try to answer in general as generally as I can. Yeah, I think it\xc2\x92s very possible, and as well as being a personal challenge, it\xc2\x92s also something that can be easily shared without reservation as I think it\xc2\x92s practically impossible to lose money if you\xc2\x92re willing and able to hold for as long as you have to if needed. From that group of 7 you might have one or two \xc2\x93disappointments\xc2\x94, but things have got to really go wrong for you to lose money. It\xc2\x92s the biggest no brainer I\xc2\x92ve ever seen in my life. Easy for me to say having been around since 2014. Easy for anyone whose been around since the early days to say the same. That having been said, it\xc2\x92s not so obvious to the newcomer, who\xc2\x92s starting at a much higher buy price and has much less knowledge. Those of us who\xc2\x92ve been around know that crypto is here to stay and that the winners are going to be worth a lot more than they are now. The key rests with your crypto picking capabilities, and why not share your conclusions with others? If you\xc2\x92re so sure about them for yourself, why not openly share them? Even at the risk of sounding like a shill! It\xc2\x92s in all of our interests to hang on to our winnings until we get fair value, isn\xc2\x92t it? One of the best things we can do is share our knowledge about that and work together to that end. There\xc2\x92s a reason why early adopters are handsomely rewarded: they invested their time, knowledge and money early on. The idea is to sell at fair value . . . after, of course, identifying the winners that will make it there. Yes, I think it\xc2\x92s very possible, and I hope there are as many of us peons as possible who do it! Some of the more technical aspects: I think the potential is there in this portfolio for a 100x gain. No doubt in my mind that the reasonable prospect is there, and \xc2\x93dead\xc2\x94 coins, third tier coins, not even 2nd tier coins are necessary in order to find these prospects. 100x gains with 1st tier crypto. That\xc2\x92s the amazing part about this! See this other thread for more thoughts of mine on this subject: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1925617.0 With regards to other possibilities: that\xc2\x92s why I invite everyone to participate, so you can put your suggestions out there too. I would only suggest that you try to stay with the basic criteria being used: high potential value crypto already performing as projected that is extremely undervalued. Technically LTC isn\xc2\x92t in that category, but the portfolio needs a conservative, yet also relatively undervalued, balance to act as the \xc2\x93bank\xc2\x94 and with BTC approaching fair value (that I estimate to be $5,000ish), LTC was chosen for that role (with a 20x conservative appreciation potential, next to BTC, it\xc2\x92s another no brainer \xc2\x96 it does everything BTC does, and much more!). And, of course, since I, or any of us, can always be wrong, I also recommend healthy debate.No time frame is set. Everything risked is risk capital capable of being completely lost. '
p15
aS"Wouldn't it be harmful for your chances to go for a 100x gain to choose a conservative approach for 50% of your portfolio?Isn't the potential of 100x growth enough reward so that busting out in some scenarios is an accaptable outcome?"
p16
aS'Perhaps. That would be a different risk tolerance level for sure. I\'m trying to build a "medium risk" portfolio with a better than average chance to make the minimum target, and when the conservative 50% has a very reasonable chance to revalue by as much as 25 times over, then you\'ve almost got the best of both worlds and something that in itself could easily satisfy the 100 grand minimum target. Said in other terms, I put the odds of LTC being worth 25 times what it is now much higher than I put those for BTS or STREEM to revalue 250 times over (which I do think is rational and doable in any event). Rather than a bunch of busts, you could get eternal double dribblers, and at some point you must move on. But perhaps your idea is better. Who knows? Post your list and we\'ll watch the two along side (or just watch the same one I posted ex-LTC). At the end of the day, it\'s mainly a risk tolerance question on my part as I am very portfolio diversified in nature, and there will also most likely be strokes of luck that will seperate the two regardless. The potential max reward doubles or triples though. \xc2\xa0'
p17
aS"Hey bud I think your portfolio is being dumped right now, how did you figure steem, pivx nxt to be anything other than the usual scam which they are?Syscoin, Nem, Bts all are jokes even Ltc is a joke all of the mentioned coins are a disgrace to crypto.Satoshi was the one and only who has disappeared and never sold a single coin of his stash, I can't tell the same thing about other devs can you?"
p18
aS'Of course it is getting dumped. Altcoins were just a way for traders to leverage profits as the value of Bitcoin was riding. This would be easier in smaller markets ofc.. '
p19
aS'I do wish you a good luck, I also investing in litecoin, but the movement of the price is really slow and kind of having a lot of setback, so you will need extra work to reach a million especially you invested 50% in litecoin, and now it is the best time to choose what alt coin to buy, because all of the price is still dropping'

aS"I used to like bittrex before but right now i am loving binance more than bittrex because binance have a lot of coins to choose from and they are also accepting the coins that have product only and if you don't have product for your coin then you will not be listed there and that is the next huge exchange in the future for sure."
p14
aS"Well the first most popular trading style and a favorite among professional traders is daily trading. But lately, many newbie traders who like daily trading. One of the main reasons why this type of trading is a trader's choice is because the risk of daily trading is not too big when compared to other types of trading. For those of you who are just learning forex trading, FYI daily trading is a method of buying and selling currency pairs in the same day. The position opened and closed will be done on the same day.You who want to get enough profit and avoid the big risk is strongly recommended to choose daily trading style. this is my trading style."
p15
aS'I like the YOBIT exchange, there are many positions and it is convenient to trade, although it often hangs, I still almost always trade on it.'
p16
aS'yobit became one of the good exchanger. the movement of buy and sell is very fast. yobit is very easy in transactions and trading. I really like yobit as a good trading exchanger.'
p17
aS'The Bittrex bourse exchange is a good one,also EXMO,Yobit and Poloniex,I pass the advantage the minimal commission and a high degree of security to the transfer of Poloniex and Bettrex.'
p18
aS"Previously I used quite a lot of commercial sites like Bittrex, Poloniex, Cryptoppia. But now I only use Binance to trade because of its lowest transaction fee and Binance's service is very good, it makes me feel satisfied when dealing. Binance is improving itself and it is a reputable address of investors who are looking for the safest transactions."
p19
aS'I trade mostly on binance and sometimes bittrex, and i use both pc and mobile phone to trade'

S'Hi all,What is your favorite trading exchange ? Why do you prefer this exchange ?Do you trade only with your PC or do you use your smartphone also ?Thanks\xc2\xa0 '
p1
aS'Bittrex and Liqui dude I prefered Bittrex and Liqui , Why? because that exchange is a user friendly exchange especially for beginners.I use that both device.'
p2
aS"I prefer Bittrex and HitBTC there safer, I am afraid to enter poloniex. With some problems everyone has left it.I trade using PC and Smartphone. That's very helpful when we're outdoors."
p3
aS'Im once a trader of poloniex and when the issues have risen on some users i tend to change or jump into another which is on bittrex and etherdelta. I do trade on both place which i do have my own pc and i do have my mobile phone. I do make trades depending on where i am. If im busy a little i would normally trade on my phone which isnt really hard at all. I love the user interface of both exchange site.'
p4
aS'Almost everyone here will vote for Bittrex as it has all the top coins which has stable coins and very less coins faded away from it. Poloniex was good until we find problems with many things. I would suggest you to stay away from low level exchanges. '
p5
aS'Why is everyone hating Poloniex that much? I gotta admit - I like Bittrex better, but everyone who left Poloniex when it was down for a few days already came back. For a few days straight - Poloniex had more volume than Bittrex.Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/'
p6
aS"Bittrex is first on my exchange list because their have big volume on bitcoin and some altcoin.Poloniex second choice because their fee very low.Etherdelta third because of import account that didn't cause fee(No need to transfer)."
p7
aS"But on Bittrex, I think it's not possible to put a limit sell order and a stop loss order at the same. Is it true ?Do you use your personal smartphone or a dedicated phone ?I think it could be dangerous to use a personal phone. What do you think ?"
p8
aS"I prefer Bittrex and Poloniex. But if im going to choose between these two exchange. I would choose Bittrex because safe and i never encountered any bad experience about this exchange. It is smooth and fast. If im not mistaken, it is a decentralized exchange which means, it don't need any documents to prove your identity. I signed up to Bittrex and they are not asking for IDs. Im usually encountered many problems with Poloniex. Sometimes i lose a lot because of their system problems. Overcrowded, that's what i see the problem behind those failures. Anyway, Kraken and Liquiexchange is popular too."
p9
aS'always i used poloniex pc and smartphone '
p10
aS'Hi there, My favorite trading exchange platform is Bittrex which was first exchange I used before. next one is poloniex I like this 2 exchange because easy to understand and use and both have great support, never had problems with them'
p11
aS"Since i'm trading with altcoins i only use Bittrex. This because it has a really simple way to use it. And i never had any troubles with deposit or withdrawal. Definetly recommend it but i unfortunately have no other trading exchange to compare so far."
p12
aS"Well for me I like Localbitcoins because they have automated escrow for peer to peer trades and we can offer multiple payment options while buying as well as selling Bitcoins with fiat currencies. I don't use it much on my mobile but on a desktop, I do use it for the passive trading purpose."
p13
aS'My favorite exchange is Bittrex because they are open and transparent with their clients unlike many others.'
p14
aS'I also have the same trust with you against bittrex, so far bittrex has the best reputation as an altcoin exchange place.Since mid-2015 ago I started trading altcoin in bittrex until now i have never experienced any serious problem with my transaction'
p15
aS"Bittrex is legitimately the best cryptocurrency exchange I've ever used.Unlike Poloniex, I've had no deposit/withdrawal issues whatsoever and their customer support actually replies to user tickets."
p16
aS"Is Poloniex as bad as people say? I've only used Bittrex so far which I never had any problem with and I'm just wondering what could go wrong with an exchange."
p17
aS'Yes bittrex does not have a stop loss feature but it is one of the best exchanges to trade alt coins right now with polo having so much trouble while withdrawing and depositing the coins,using smart phone is a personal choice and i am not comfortable using it,just use my smart phone for 2fa purposes when it comes to trading. '
p18
aS'Bittrex is my first choice I also like poloniex but I like bittrex more because it makes new coins available for trade rather quickly than poloniex. I use both laptop and smartphone.'
p19
aS'I cannot say its favorite but what is use are Bittrex, Poloniex, Bitfinex and Nova Exchange.'
p20
aS"One of the reason why I don't want to trade on poloniex since its not friendly for mobile users thats why I grab the Bittrex and cryptopia whenever I want to trade by using my phone and also these two exchange are great for having a good trades since mostly the coins who's been listed here may got a potential to gain more value unlike to those underdog exchange where there's only few big supporters who do trades on there."
p21
aS'i am trading in poloniex and bittrex and i prefer with those sites because in poloniex, we can choose many potential coins and we can make profit too if we select the right coin. in bittrex, we can see there is many coins that sometimes having increasing so if we can follow the coins trade, we can make big profit.i am trade with my pc but sometimes if i am mobile, i use my smartphone also to trade and place my order buy and sell. but when i use my smartphone, sometime my signal is not good so i missed the time to buy and sell, but its no problem.'
p22
aS'My choice of exchange would be bittrex. I had been using Poloniex at the beginning but since it started giving issues to \xc2\xa0its users made me jump over to bittrex.Bittrex is quite user friendly and everything you need is just right there in front of you. It also has a variety of coins to trade and three markets for exchanging.I use my laptop for trading most of the times but when i am outside and if my laptop is not available then i manage it with my smartphone.Bittrex is accessible via phones too and it gives the same interface to you as on desktop site.'
p23
aS'Since there is a lot of new coins in bittrex and they seem that they are all active. I choose bitrrex over all of the other trading exchange because i am comfortable with the security of bittrex and also their simplicity and easy to use controls and in their chart, i can use different tools or draw some lines for more efficient and effective technical analysis which i really like.'
p24
aS"Definitely bittrex, however not by a far margin.This is due to the fact that the amount of complaints regarding bittrex seems to be increasing. I do not know for sure whether it's just because poloniex lost a lot of their customers due to the fact that trollbox got shut down and whatnot leading to bittrex having to handle way more customers than it's used to, or it's just bittrex slacking off. Either way, it's their fault.Exchanges are getting stricter and stricter regarding KYC, which is a real pain in the ass. I use shapeshift for my day to day altcoin transactions now, it's worth the premium."
p25
aS"I love bittrex and poloniex but right now I use bittrex in exchange since I have no more btc in my poloniex account. What I love in bittrex because it has a low deposit in terms of bitcoin amount. The only thing I do not like in the other exchange site poloniex is that it has low fee if you will withdraw your bitcoins what I do not like poloniex is that it has high amount if you will deposit in there site so if you have only small amount of bitcoins or alts to be trade you can't trade to poloniex but all in all I love this exchange site both."
p26
aS'That is good questions, my favorite trading exchange is Kraken due to Kraken is reliable, there are no scam coins to be traded on there, so i can be more focus trading altcoins on there with no much the altcoins, the other reason i choose Kraken due to it support for smartphone,It makes easy to trading altcoins on there can be saw on every where.'
p27
aS"Bittrex, bro. It's easy to use, comfortable for beginner"
p28
aS'I traded on bitcoin.co.id , poloniex, bittrex and sometime on quoine.com i prefer this exchangers not all of them but just poloniex and bittrex for trading altcoins because they are big markets on altcoins trading fluctuating of price is very huge getting profit from there are easy and bitcoin.co.id is just for Indonesian people, it is local market, i always use smartphone to traded bitcoins and altcoins.'
p29
aS'My favorite exchanger are Bittrex and poloniex because most of the coins are listed in both exchange company. I analyze my trade with the use of pc particularly the technical analysis aspects of trading so that I will be able to view the candle stick movement well before placing trade .And I equally check my position on my smart phone whether am making profit or not.'
p30
aS"Yeah this is true. Bittrex is a friendly user to all like its not that complicated to trade.Plus, this is a major exchange so mostly of the coins are listed here. Also a lot of traders are using this so its easy to place an order. I've been using this since I started trading and so far I'm good with it. Just also remember, don't store your coins in any exchange as it might lose there."
p31
aS"I always liked Poloniex's trading environment, but because of their shaky status in the past year I have also moved to Bittrex as my main exchange. For fun activities, I enjoy Cryptopia and the Waves Dex."
p32
aS'several years ago i was so often trade at poloniex because this exchange provide good feature such as low fees and plenty market support but since there is several unresolved issue regarding withdrawal and deposit account for some people so i decide to leave them and bittrex is my second options and currently besides my local exchange bittrex always be my main option for altcoin trading'
p33
aS'My favorite crypto exchange is Bittrex. I also trade in Poloniex and Etherdelta and Liqui.io .. I do not put my bitcoin in a single trading site. As wise people said, do not put all your egg in a single basket.'
p34
aS'Poloneix and Bittrex\xc2\xa0 Buying orders are high in these exchanges as compared to other exchanges like liqui, yobit etc.'
p35
aS'I highly recommend people to use bittrex because it is the best trading website. They support their customers very good. not like poloniex, their activities are very shady. Do not use poloniex because you might lose your money there. Many of my firends have suffered huge loss in this exchange '
p36
aS'My favorite trading exchange is BITTREX, for altcoins trading and investment, I have tried poloniex, but it is a bit slow. I will use both laptop and mobile for trading.'
p37
aS"I have actually used several exchange sites while some of the big names I am yet to experience the one that I liked most is C-CEX and the reason is because the way they handle tickets , it's something I love and the withdrawal is instant the moment you follow through with the instructions while they are equally on ground to provide response in case of any difficulty."
p38
aS'Many people here are suggesting Bittrex for everyone especially the newcomers. I just used this and seriously saying it is really good to use it. It is so user friendly. Everything is just being explained and displayed to you as long as you know the bits and cubs of trading. So highly recommended.'
p39
aS'I trade with different exchanges site . I CHOOSE BITTREX I LIKE THE STYLE OF BITTREX EASY TO USE . YOU CAN UNDERSTAND EASILY JUST NOT LIKE OTHER THE FEATURESIS REALLY HARD TO UNDEDSTAND. Sometimes I use smart phone when I on a bed butsometimes I use laptop for trading because If I use laptop i can see all while the smart phone limited I can see and its very little text.'
p40
aS'Hey guys. Is bittrex good yo use if you are from canada'
p41
aS'Do you trade before to fall asleep? Is that legal, my gf asked me to stop doing it. '
p42
aS'Yes it is good to use.I use Bittrex and Cryptopia'
p43
aS"It's depend on the exchanges, if the exchanges have the altcoin that i want to trade then i will use that exchanges but i usually use bittrex because most of altcoin that i trade is on bittrex too. I prefer bittrex than other exchanges because i feel save when i trading on this site. I only trading using my laptop/pc, i never using my phone for trading though."
p44
aS'true, because many coins are in liqui.io, but not in bittrex and in poloniex. besides, so many market with eth platform, so it is very difficult to determine favorite trading exchange, because the place is separated'
p45
aS"My favorite trading exchange is listed below: https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/ but it's not mobile browser supported exchange platform. https://www.bittrex.com/ bittrex also have the same problem, I can't feel comfortable with my mobile browser. https://liqui.io/ liqui is best one to me.its also have the mobile supported option and easy to use also. And the last one is: https://poloniex.com/ it's a good platform for trading but I use this site only some times."
p46
aS'about altcoin exchange my favorite bittrex, good volume transaction, and good new coin with succes ico selling listing in thereiam only trade use PC or laptop, bcause is easy if use PC'
p47
aS"For me bittrex because it's secured like, when you open your account at another ip address you need to verify it in your email otherwise you can not open it. Easy to deposit BTC, Do not accept shitcoins and much more. So they are the first of all the trusted exchanger in the world. We are confident that we will not lose money"
p48
aS'That is why i also like bittrex because they are safe in terms of handling our account because if something was trying to log in my account from different address i got a notification from bittrex itself and even though loggin in from the same ip address they still give your report for the successful log ins which is really like for a trading site aside from their very simple and a lot of altcoins to choose from.'
p49
aS"Bittrex is good for canadian person but you must try to use the kraken, but never use polo exchange because too many problem has faced by the exchange site with all of their users. A lot of people are complaining about the polo's performance. "
p50
aS"bittrex is a good choice for trading because I've been using bittrex exchange for trading or buying and selling transactions, besides poloniex can also be used as a destination for trading."
p51
aS'My favorites trading exchangers platforms are poloniex and livecoin. Poloniex is very popular and user friendly it also has alot of volume and many altcoins. I have never have problems with my drawing and deposit. Livecoin on the others hand has growth significantly and there are doing very well now. Most of the trader on this site can actually testified that livecoin are highly reliable and you can easily convert your bitcoin to dollars.\xc2\xa0 I used my smartphone to trade.'
p52
aS'I think poloniex is good why some of post here saying poloniex is not recommended,i use poloniex and its so good,i love the conveniece of poloniex that brings to me in terms of trading '
p53
aS'vip bitcoin and bittrex, I think bittrex is very user friendly and simple. Using PC at home and smartphone when outside'
p54
aS'yes its good but not just from canada, i think from other country is good too. beside bittrex, i use poloniex as my main trading site and cryptopia, coin exchange as additional trading exchange. if you prefer with big list of coins, you can go with bittrex and coin exchange. if you need more experience, you can go with poloniex.'
p55
aS'I think both Bittrex and Poloniex are very good options for trading and most of the coins will not be listed in Poloniex. Bittrex is the second exchange where we can find many coins which will give higher profits. '
p56
aS"Bittrex is for me.They have plenty enough of orderbook and coins. I like it's design as well."
p57
aS"This is the real truth that currently Bitrex is a better option for the traders because it has the fascility to do trading at mobile easily because the site is much responsive for the mobile user , so a example of better devlopment .Beside of the Bitrex my best one is the yobit.net , the reason to use this exchange is because this exchange never delist coin , so if we can buy any coin and get much dead then in that case the coin will still remain in the yobit exchange , so we don't need to take any tension to mover our coins from exchange to exchange or Wallet because of delist .And mostly here i uses bitrex only at mobile and yobit at pc , because yobit is not much better option for the trading at the mobile ."
p58
aS"Yes, i agree with you Poloniex is a good exchange. I've been trading there for a long time. But sometimes i experience system failure. Sometimes i loss huge amount because of that. That's why i tried Bittrex. It's so simple and easy to use. For livecoin, uhmm... It's just okay. It has good user interface and easy to use. But the sad thing is, it has no mobile site for mobile users like me. Also a lot of trash coin. Just C-cex and Yobit. But i never encountered any problem with them. Kraken also is good exchange. I haven't tried it though. But a lot of traders recommend Kraken. "
p59
aS'I am very happy to use bittrex as the main exchange I always use. Here are many features available. In addition I can also trade securely without any worry any time.'
p60
aS'This is true and i would suggest the same exchange too because of their interface which is really user friendly and its easy to use specially when you are just a beginner and i didnt experience any problems with them. You can trade on both pc and smartphone as long its capable on running those sites and do have connection.'
p61
aS"i like to trade on BTC-e earlier but FBI seized them very badly so i don't think they gonna resume their services again."
p62
aS"look there are many crypto exchanges world wide but we have to chose them according to our need, like in which country we are living and which banks do this platform provide exchanged money.as i'm from Pakistan so is use urdubit for exchange. well if there is other trading exchange then suggest it to me."
p63
aS"what's the general opinion on yobit ??"
p64
aS"Here in my opinion the best trading exchange is bitfinex and poloniex . May be few people were facing problem in last month but still here i am with these two trading exchange because we need to make our trsde with the coins speedly\xc2\xa0 .In these two exchange the users are available in bulk and doing trading with daily turn over of\xc2\xa0 about 20 to 2000 btc , so it is easy to buy at low and sell at high in minimum time for a particular coin than what we need to wait for long time at another low numbered users exchange like cryptopia , yobit etc .Here i don't meant that yobit and crypopia are not better but still they have some better things which we like that is yobit code and transfer of coins from user to another free of charge ( exchange to same exchange only ) .But still the trade time is consume much , so better for thr newbie only and also better when we need to make trade from one exchange to another (exchange trading )."
p65
aS'I advise you to Liqui. On this exchange, many new coins come out and only after Polonix and Bittrex. While the coin is sold on the liqui and does not go on a large exchange, it can be bought at a very low price. sorry for my English'
p66
aS'I prefer to trading in bittrex. because I am not very expert in trading and I was also first introduced to this trade exchange and have not dared to try another trade exchange.Yes, I do transactions using pc only if I am at home and use my smartphone while traveling.'
p67
aS'These are some of the biggest, not necessarily the best. I prefer Poloniex because they have many coins to trade to/from. They disabled deposits and withdrawals to STEEM for some time without a clear reason though. Maybe because it\xc2\xb4s moving more and more each time.'
p68
aS'I would say paxful and localbitcoin'
p69
aS'before im just using my smartphone to trade cause i started trading in ccex but now i prefer poloniex and bittrex its still possible to trade using smartphone but its more efficient in my lappy'
p70
aS'im more comfortable using my smartphone while tradingi prefer poloniex to do my daytrade the market\xc2\xa0 volume is huge therethough sometimes i trade in livecoin ,yobit and ccex now im eyeing bittrex but i found it difficult to use on may smartphone'
p71
aS"Bittrex and local exchange, nothing else. This is the second year I use Bittrex for trading and make me comfortable. They give me a good services about how to get transaction fast and secure. Even sometimes slowly but still can accepted because there's notice. Local exchange give me the easy way to get local currencies as I need with low fee. Until now using pc and never smartphone. Have a nice day."
p72
aS'Its Bittrex.com and poloniex.com is my favorite trading exchange.'
p73
aS"I've been using Poloniex for about a year and I've been pleased with it so far. I have heard some complaints about withdrawals taking a long time but I have not experienced those problems. The only negative to be is that they took the chat box off. I don't keep a lot of my money on any exchanges because you always should be careful about security. Never trust exchanges with the bulk of your Bitcoins or altcoins. Just use them for trading a portion of your coins."
p74
aS'I don\xc2\xb4t have a favourite...I really have three. Poloniex: even with all the issues with support for me it\xc2\xb4s still the easiest to use, have the lending option and good volume. Number 2 is cryptopia to play around with low volume low price coins. Some good profit to be made and some bags of shit coins around the corner as well. Liqui for pos ICO trades and TAAS.'
p75
aS'I use Bittrex for nearly all my trades (but their charts are lame so I use Coinigy to supplement) except specific exchanges for specific coins only / best available there, such as Cryptopia (to accumulate a few up-and-coming coins) and Binance (to receive GAS for NEO on exchange)'
p76
aS"Bittrex right now is by far the best one.We know a lot of people use Poloniex but their interface is so amateur and horrible for day trading. If you're perhaps looking to do less frequent trading, then Polo is alright."
p77
aS'I think that Poloniex is the best exchanger at the moment, some people in this thread said that this exchanger was soo amateur for daytrading, but that is wrong, it is an easy-to-use exchanger and anyone can do daytrading in this exchanger, i think its perfect.By the way, i dont use to trade much, i just buy coins and then transfer to my main wallet, and i wanna sell i just do the same.I dont like having money on exchangers'
p78
aS'i think bittrex is best exchanger. i use pc and smartphone for trade.'
p79
aS'i love poloniex for its becoming more user friendy and great interface .its also a bery famous site and all the big traders trade here . with a lots of btc in their wallet it also supports marging trading loan taking /giving .my second favourite site is bittrex its also very good but not much friendly like\xc2\xa0 poloniex'
p80
aS'I also prefer Bittrex than other exchanges because of its easy user interface and faster transactions. The trade bot is great, Bid and ask works flawlessly to me so I stay with Bittrex. used Nova and Yobit for lower coins but those have bugs. '
p81
aS'After BTC-e Service falls i would say that poloniex is only the trading exchange right now with huge liquidity to trade on it. There are some other exchanges are also available but no one can beat BTC-e.'
p82
aS'Bitrex have clean interface but sometime they delays the withdrawals but they are best to credit XMR deposits as compare to deposits of XMR in poloniex.'
p83
aS'For me thes best trading site will always be the bittrex. I really really want the feutures of that trading site. It is good and quiet impressive. The user interface is good also it is easy to uae by the beginners and it is interesting to trade there. And somehow the security is very good also. That is my most favorite\xc2\xa0 among all.'
p84
aS'I think that the best exchanger at the moment is Poloniex, it is too easy to use it and you can manage all the altcoins without previous knowledge. It is very easy to execute trades and this platform has a lot of seccurity so you wont be hacked too easy.So yes, at\xc2\xa0 the moment i think this is the best exchange, maybe others thinks that Bittrex is the best one, but bittrex has a lot of more altcoins and that is a possitive feature.'
p85
aS'I like poloniex in terms of trading because i dont know bitrex,bitgrail and mercatox,i always check the current price of every altcoins in poloniex as far as i dont having a problem like the others here in poloniex to trade,i will do my trading in poloniex thats all i can say if you dont like poloniex then dont trade '
p86
aS'First know exchange local\xc2\xa0 Finally always i used vip.bitcoin.co.id from my pc and smartphone.'
p87
aS'Poloniex is having a lot of complains for the past months because their site is not so secured and there is a lot of things that is bad in that site and i prefer bittrex because it is secured, simple and very user-friendly. It is one of the most popular exchange that most of the people in my country use because of the volume of altcoins that can be trade where poloniex lacks off.'
p88
aS'i guess diversify and try to get coins into wallets to see if works.'
p89
aS'I like poloniex too before i was always do trading in poloniex because so friendly user the only thing i dont like in poloniex is they have only a few limited coins in there and too crowded already'
p90
aS'I like trading in bittrex, because there is more complete, simple and more updates. exchange even faster.currently I use PC, because access is faster.'
p91
aS'I prefer poloniex for trading bitcoin> altcoin, I prefer trading altcoin because it can double my bitcoin safely and without fear of losing my bitcoin.'
p92
aS'I am start trading\xc2\xa0 few days.But I think bittrex is the best exchanger.'
p93
aS'Most exchange that I used most often was Bittrex.com, but before I was using Poloniex but because of some issues happened before in the Poloniex, I decided to transferred all my coins into bittrex, due to it is one of I can considered as established exchange platform which I can considered compare to Poloniex and never been have any issue problems compare to poloniex.'
p94
aS'Most of the time i use bittrex and poloniex.between them bittrex is more favourite because i think its easy to use and has more security. sometime also i use other exchange for my bounties.because all the bounty dont listed on only bittrex and poloniex.'
p95
aS"I always use and preferred bittrex as trading exchange as its a friendly user like its not too complicated to use. And mostly of the new coins that came from ico are easily listed here so this is the first exchange that I checked.I'm using my pc and smart phone when trading. I use my pc when im at home and smart phone when Im at work and I like using phone to track the exchange wherever I am."
p96
aS"I prefer poloniex because the altcoin is just a little bit quicker than I can remember the market movement. Poloniex is just a bitcoin's withdrawal fee and if I use the smartphone pretty every time when you login he asks the code you get in your email .. I just do not know why many say that is not secured c poloniex"
p97
aS'Bittrex FTW. Fast verification, no problems with withdrawal/cashouts, lots of altcoins. Tested myself for 15btc, still keep a few btc on that exchange just in case i would need to do some quick trade. '
p98
aS'Bittrex is user friend and I make this site as my main site to trade in since I am a phone user and this site is the esiest one to access on. They have also the Good potential coins today and volume are having a great run on certain alts so i prefer to trade on this site.'
p99
aS"From the very beginning I am using bittex for Exchange.Bittrex is obviously no1 exchange site at my eyes.I can use it for both as a wallet and trading platform for crypto curreny.It's very easy to use for all so newbie can use it without any skill.I am using bittrex from 2014 and I haven't faced any problems while using it.Their customer support is very good.Again,Bittrex offer 2 factor authentication which is great security."
p100
aS"Bittrex is my favourite exchange!!No problems with withdrawals and deposits! Although some deposits takes time especially the BTC ones which shows pending always.But I'm facing one problem in Bittrex I can't verify my phone. I've tried several times but still I don't recieve any PIN code in my mobile."
p101
aS"Poloniex used to be my favorite exchange because it's fast and reliable. But recently they doing shit with TOS updates and dozen of pending and disable deposit/withdraw. So I quit using them.For now I'm using Bittrex or Blocktrades to exchange my currency. So far I haven't been in trouble with them"
p102

Although it has a good level of bittrex but surely there is a weakness, so we should also have a good level of security, as indeed there is in the system though bittrex has good security but accounts that we have It is not necessarily safe. Because that holds account data we have is yourself, so all in all forms of hacker is due to our carelessness.'

p141
aS"For easier and faster moves I really prefer bittrex, it's the most comfortable exchange currently, no other exchanges is closer to bittrex.I like liqui too but there are some issues with them reported from users, also I like poloniex the lead exchange with lots and top currencies with top traded volume in 24 mostly for popular coins!What I don't like in poloniex is the waiting time which sucks a lot, deposit time for bitcoin is good but for ETH not, also the withdrawal for bitcoin sucks too, it takes up to 24 hours usually but in some cases days or weeks."

p151
aS"Yobit and novaexchange is good platform for trading but both of them volume is too low.so why i little use them.I use bittrex,polo,liqui,karken etc.all of are has huge volume and easy to use also.yobit and novaexchange also doesn't support all of crypto, specially new altcoin."
p152
aS'I am also fan of bittrex. Though there are numerous exchanges available but bittrex have great edge over them. Bittrex is not only easy to use but transactions made here are quite safer and faster than many other exchanges. Poloniex is on second number in my list of bets exchanges.'
p153
aS'For Bittrex is not just my favorite but also the best. There are not so many shitcoins that are listed there and the best thing is there are many traders especially whales.'
p154
aS"For me bittrex is pretty much like polo. I'm trading in any of these two if i'm trading with a big amount. I also like trading with small coins in yobit. Here i can trade with a lot of minor coins not available in these two other exchanges. Just to practice how to ride pumps and dumps"
p155
aS"I use polonix but don't like it and will probably change having read some of the feeds"
p156
aS"I too would prefer to use bittrex as my main exchange site not because it's my favorite rather its the most trusted exchange and has a good interface for traders. Anyway, I too use different exchange since not all token are on bittrex except for Yobit which has a lot of problems and shitcoins. Anyway, about on how to access it whether to use phone or PC, most exchange out there have already adopted on these things so both can be use to access them but it's much easier on PC. "
p157
aS'I always used random trading exchange website but here are the top i use for exchange and trade my bitcoin into altcoin poloniex , bittrex , yobit , c-cex some of trading exchange i always visit them because i always looking for cheap price and then i will visit another trading exchange to see if the cheap coins there is expensive to make profit well this happens to me every week try not to stick on one trading site.'
p158
aS'Bittrex has a lot of goodsmall-cap altcoins and compared to Liqui for example, it has low withdrawal fees.'
p159
aS'My favorite trading exchange is poloniex because it has a very limited amount of altcoins that we can trade and they are very strict to the altcoins that they will add to their exchange and it has a lot of users and already have a huge reputation in the world for being one of the best trading exchange.'
p160
aS"I agree with you, but there are some glitches and bugs on bittrex's market from time to time. For example, yesterday I wanted to withdraw some coins to another wallet and I couldn't do it. The system asked me to verify my account, but I use my profile for a long time, so it was a mistake. And situations like this are normal for this platform "
p161
aS"I like using Poloniex and Bitfinex personally. They have different looking platforms but they seem to look and work fine for me. Poloniex has more coins than Bitfinex but Bitfinex have some coins that Poloniex doesn't have. It's also good to spread your coins on a few exchanges to reduce risk. And of course keep most of your coins off exchanges completely."
p162
aS'My favorite exchanges are poloniex, bittrex and cryptopia for small quantities. Do trading using pc because less familiar with smartphone. I am trader longterm, so only occasionally in one day i open to see my open order at exchanges.'
p163
aS'No doubt poloneix is the best exchange for altcoins. It is also the largest crypto exchange in terms of volume. But if a person is a newbie then I think it is good for him to go with Coinbase. Both exchanges come in the top 5 and Coinbase secure first position.'
p164
aS'My favorite trading exchanger is Bittrex. Because it has the best service and does not accept low volumes Altcoins. Besides that I also liked their censorship for every person who made the acc. here. By passing the identities. Additionally they have two factor autintacations where you can not open your acc without ever confirming your mobile phone. So Bittrex is so great.'
p165
aS"I just like trading with any exchange that has decent volume and I can also access their graph through tabtrader. I'm more concerned with technical analysis than fundamental in crypto trading"
p166
aS'You are very much right. I will suggest the same trading exchange. The reason why so many people are going for Bittrex is none other than its reputation which it is carrying in the world of exchange. I think it is far more secure than any other exchange and is more convenient to use. You should give it a try at least once.'
p167
aS"Poloniex has had a lot of complaints in the past few months because their site is not guaranteed and there are a lot of bad things on the site and I like bittrex because it's secure, simple and very friendly. This is one of the most common exchanges that most people in my country use because altcoins mass may be commercial that poloniex lacks."
p168
aS"My favorite exchanges are:LocalBitcoinsandNexchangeLBC is expensive but rock-solid and reliable. They have been around since 2012 and wallets have never been seriously compromised in any way. That says a lot considering how many others have come and gone in that time span.Nexchange is very reliable and also super simple, not to mention you don't even need to sign up. It is 100% anonymous."
p169
aS'I use poloniex before but due to the issues with withdrawal and others, I decided to pull out my funds there and transferred to Bittrex since it has also more trading volume there. By joining some groups in social media, I discovered that many of them are also using Bittrex and some are in cryptopia and yobit as well. I trade with PC because it is easier to navigate and I look at many things before I trade and open a position.'
p170
aS'I have never tried any\xc2\xa0 other exchange but I can say bittrex has not disappointed me since I started using the platform.'

Few days ago there is a mirror of that site was opened but i am not sure that they are real BTC-e or fake.But no matter they start their service again or not but i will surely not gonna trust them again to loose my money . Beware if anyone want to re join them .'

aS"There are many trusted exchangers with each advantage features:- Poloniex : Biggest exchangers , withdraw with really low fee ( 0.0001 i love this one ). This website has the most coins on the market. But sometime it's really lag.- Bittrex : Quite nice. Fee is average (0.0005). But this exchangers worked smooth not lag like poloniex. - Liqui.io : Many coins ( actually i didn't use this exchanger often, i used to sell ROUND coin on the website)"
p173
aS"Yes, when compared to other exchange Poloniex is one of the best exchange and at the same time, i like Bittrex is also other where we get some reputable coin in Bittrex also. Both these exchanges have higher volumes in the market, of course, each one has it's own identity in the market."
p174
aS"Well these two exchanges i think are the top two choices for most traders and there's a lot of good reason to it. I also do trades with yobit because there are more smaller coins to trade with that i can practice with smaller amounts. "
p175
aS'I have been trading in bittrex and poloniex and up to now I am still trading in both exchanges, because for me these two exchanges are very good in transaction services'
p176
aS'yea its a shame it got shut down it was the best site i used to love the troll box all the crazy stuff the guys where saying and also sometimes some guys would give you some good advice but others would just try to get you into the dump and pump death trap .

p179
aS"I also trade on the Bittrex exchange. But it seems to me that Yo.bit is more convenient. There is a graph and it's convenient to place orders. In Bittrex a little uncomfortable design is made"
p180
aS'Bittrex is the best in my opinion, in addition to a fairly complete selection of coins. Fast service support'
p181
aS'yes the reason you use bittrex for trading is right, I also use bittrex for trading, although my bittrex account was ever disabled by bittrex, but I still use it because bittrex has good service and security in my opinion.'

It makes me more comfortable than others due to its fastness. Around hundred and fifty or so coins has been updated there in which I will always find my coins. So that's the another advantage too. Livecoin also list almost all the ICO which are here on the forum itself. Just love it the way it works. "

p193
aS'I do not like Bittrex that much. I have used it for some time, but it lacks volume as compared to poloniex, which would be my first choice. But that is because I usually trade LTC, DOGE, ETH... major currencies and not new altcoins (I guess bittrex is better for that)'

Poloniex only can be worked on Desktop, Smartphone will miss some important display that you need when you want to exchange from some coin to other coins. So if you use desktop any exchangers are ok but if you use mobile, don't go to poloniex.com"
p240
aS"My favorite trading exchange, I think is probably bittrex, that's where I made the first exchange, that's where I started and to the present I still feel it's good for me. One of the highlights of Bittrex is security, they are responsible for the customer and they consider it serious. Group exchanges also look for new altcoin source code before posting on the trading floor to ensure it is the best. Beside Bittrex, poloniex is also my choice, it is also quite safe and tightly checked, Poloniex also offers many exchange markets. Although it also has some shortcomings but I still find it to be quite good  "

p268
aS"I like bittrex more because it has NEO but I still use poloniex for the cheaper maker fees. There's been a lot of negative reviews on poloniex though and you should be taking it into account. Also as of today, Bittrex has more volume trade than poloniex. Had thoughts of moving everything to bittrex."
p269
aS'Poloniex and bittrex are my favourites ones, but i really like the function of Blockchain wallet, in where you can exchange your bitcoins to ethereum and vice-versa, they are going to add litecoin and dash in a few weeks as far as i know, so they are trying to make their own exchange in their wallet, it is a nice idea so i dont have to dump my coins to another wallet/exchange, just because i only exchange my bitcoins to ethereum or litecoin.'
p270
aS'Bittrex is my first choice for trading because mostly\xe2\x80\x8b i trade here. It is the international platform which is more well known by people. I think the service of it very clear. Besides it, i trade on cryptopia, coinexchange,poloniex too. I seem bittrex is the best option to select.'

p276
aS"I got all my money off Poloniex (finally). Too many horror stories, and I had too much on there given the risk of collapse and the low withdrawal limits for my verification tier. I trade on Bittrex for altcoins and 1Broker for stocks/commodities/forex. I miss 1Broker's BTCUSD market -- it has an amazing trading interface and they have been trustworthy/reliable for years. I can't wait for their new service (called 1Fox) to open up. Should be soon, according to the timeline they gave a few months back."
p277

p281
aS'I also had problems with Poloniex. Their support his horrible. Now I am mostly using Kraken and Bittrex. Kraken is not that great either. I had some issues with the Stellar Lumens airdrop, and it took them one month to resolve it. '
p282
aS"I haven't tried poloniex, maybe some time I'll try to trade there.Well as for me, I always trade in bittrex as I find it less complicated to use. Even a first time trader can trade here like you can easily follow the instructions. And I also use hitbtc when the a certain coin isn't available in bittrex. At first I thought that it's hard to trade there but it went all smoothly. Good thing I tried hitbtc, at least I have other option."
p283
aS"I would say that Bittrex is the best cryptocurrency exchange I have used, the site is efficient and user friendly, which makes users to familiarise themselves with the site very quick. New comers can easily trade with Bittrex, I know this because I started using bittrex since I was a newbie and even now I am still using it and I didn't encounter any difficulties throughout my trading experience.I also love the security on the website, you cannot easily get hacked. I have tried using all the other exchanges but I would say that Bittrex is still the best even if some coins are not listed there."
p284
aS'As far as trading exchange is concerned, I think there is no match of Bittrex. I will second you without having a second thought even. It is indeed the most popular and trustworthy trading exchange all over the world. Poloniex too is a good option but Bittrex is the best option. You should give it a try at least once.'
p285
aS"Same with the security that cryptopia also having and the 2fa confirmations really will help you maintain that safer transactions specially on the withdrawal process. Even if bittrex was known to be the best, but I think it'll now be changed one I got trading with cryptopia, and the experiences I had went very fast and no errors encountered. That's why I recommended this site to all who planned trading their coins."
p286
aS"I guess poloniex never really helped themselves by trying to strive among competitions. I have never seen a platform with such an extremely poor support most especially when you know it has to do with people's fund which could easily cause them to be aggravated easily."
p287
aS"Bittrex for is the most trusted exchange for me. I always trade here and it's working fine with me. Even when I still a beginner I didn't have a hard time trading. User friendly and it caters a lot of coins so no need to go to other exchange, but of course when it's necessary I trade to others. But I never store my coins here for better safe keeping."
p288
aS'I will second you without having a second thought. I think the top leading trading exchange in the market is none other than Bittrex. It is the most trustworthy and most widely used trading exchange. There are few other trading exchanges as well but there is no match of Bittrex. The best thing about it is that there is no risk of losing your money.'
p289
aS"https://bit-x.com is my first choice then https://bitfinex.com. Bit-X is very reliable, very simple to use and still have awesome features for the more experienced traders. Plus they offer a bitcoin debit card so I can use my Bitcoin whenever/wherever without selling it in advance. It's an all in one exchange platform (wallet for small amount of funds too). "
p290
aS'Honestly, I think they really got it here. If you lose it at the support level, then you have the chances of losing your users easily. Poloniex failed to realise that the few days they were having challenges, I really hope they have realised that now and have made changes.'
p291
aS'I just use only etherdelta to trade now. we can trade any eth token on this platform without waiting it list on other echange'

aS'So far i am using Bittrex to keep all my coins.'
p294
aS"I don't like poloniex. Reading lots of negative things about it. Bittrex is way better than it in terms of security, volume and variety of tokens. I can find all kind of tokens there in bittrex platform. I also like etherdelta, but it's too slow. "
p295
aS'Actually bittrex exchange is my favorite because it is friendly and easy to use with very nice GUI not like poloniex which is very fast and confusing me a lot.'
p296
aS"Personally i don't see polo to be that hard to navigate. Even the mobile version is pretty easy to use same as with bittrex. I guess it just takes time and i've been dealing with a lot of exchanges so i'm kinda used to different exchange interface"
p297
aS"Because I started trading on Bittrex. The bittrex is what I think is better. it is the top of all the exchanger and the transaction fee is low here, I'm more concerned about it because they care about our accounts where we can not open it to another IP Address if we can not compromise our gmails. I could have hackers who might try to open it is really difficult. But I can not even say the other exchanger might have a good service, It's my opinion"
p298
aS"Bittrex and poloniex are better when it comes to user friendly interface and a few of the major crypto currency exchanges, and it's also recommended by most of the crypto currency users. These exchanges allow you to use them in your smartphone and your pc, providing another reason on why to use it. And most of the reputed and potential coins are listed in these exchanges which is the main reason why I use it. "
p299
aS'My favourite trading exchange is actully poloniex. But i use two trading exchange site. This is bittrex. Bittrex is the mostly trading exchange site. But poloniex is my first choise then bittrex. I do trading from my smartphone because i have no pc at present.'
p300
aS"I do most of my trades in PC since it is way faster to begin with. I've traded on Poloniex, Bittrex, Liqui, Livecoin and I find myself using Livecoin and Poloniex more often. I do like their interfaces, for it easily display current pricing of each token up to date and it also shows recent transaction which can be of great help when you are dealing with many tokens. "
p301
aS'why poloniex? i mean bittrex is leading trading site so far, and its traders are well satisfied. give me one solid reason so that i may turn my self into poloniex because i heard some good vibes about this site.'
p302
aS'I use Yobit and Livecoin but my favorite is Livecoin because sometimes I dont need to solve captca to login ,login is faster,dont need to check email for code and in Yobit I need,also Livecoin have coins which I more like and it looks better.'
p303
aS'I did not heard about Liquid but other two are familiar ones. However, I myself have used only poloneix and bittrex since ever. Personally I like poloneix more and I think it has more users than bittrex or any other exchange. I am fully satisfied with their services and fee. Well, everyone has his own priorities and we cannot find all facilities in one exchange.'
p304
aS"I'm getting interested in etherdelta and hitbtc, now poloniex and bittrex want to improve system quality and shitcoin cleaning by not accepting new coins indiscriminately. And finally the volume of coins moved to the first two markets above because it can enter quickly and actively in the trade. These four markets remain a favorite and have portions that I can manage."
p305
aS'For me i use Bittrex it is more convenient to use I can even access to it on my laptop and as well as in my mobile phone so far i never encounter any problems yet using bittrex flatform so i can recommend it.'

Sometimes I use smsrtphones to trade but when Im trade Im must prefer to use laptop because its big screen and you will see all the things that you need to see while in smartphone is limited because its little.'
p307
aS'I heard a lot of bittrex that is legit and this exchager was prepared most of the crypto-currency user. I never used the bittrex or poloniex, Hitbtc is one exchager I used but many said that it is scam, but I never encounter a problem. I use also cryptopia and tidex, my friends recommend this because of token price. For me I choose the exchager which the price is better but legit. And before I choose those exchager I get some opinion to my GC and read the reviews.'
p308
aS'Bittrex.It is simple:more coins there and it means: more future '
p309
aS'I like to exchange in bittrex, because I feel safe there, and for second choice I use hitbtc, both become my favorite exchange site at this time. the main reason is that the fees are not too big, and there are lots of altcoin options that I can buy to exchange, and large enough volumes to be one of my reasons too'
p310
aS'for altcoin, bittrex and poloniex.for btc, OKEX and bitmex (they both provide leverage trading)also look out for other smaller exchanges that offer better feesbinance, coss.io, coinut, exmo and etc.you can PM me for referral link '

p312
aS'I think bittrex is still the best exchanger for now even though it has a cost of 0.001 for withdrawal, but the ease of bittrex transactions in trading transactions makes me feel confident that bittrex is my best choice in trading.

p319
aS"Initially, my favorite trading exchange had been bittrex, since the end of september however, as Chinese coins bounced back and many other variable such as bittrex, not listing anymore new coins and binance listing a bunch of coins everyday, my favorite new exchange became binance.Although their graphs and trading takes a little getting used to, I actually prefer their trading platform now because the fees there are half as expensive as bittrex's if you use binance coin. Additionally, buying coins there are faster so it would be easier for people who day trade."
p320
aS"For security and comfort issues then bittrex remains the best. there is currently no exchange that can provide such a thing. bittrex has survived very long as an international exchange. I'm sure I'll feel safe saving a lot of bitcoin here. compared with an exchange that only has a poor capability. it might be possible to lose the bitcoin we have. now there are many exchanges that managed to be hacked by hackers or they just pretend to divert the issue. This is clear evidence that the world's very few find the exchange that has quality."

p323
aS"With all of the exchange/trading sites that I've tried, the one that I like the most is Cryptopia. This site is actually user-friendly. There is also regular updates on the values of the cryptos/altcoins listed on them. The site also allows users to have a 2FA for their accounts, which I think is very important especially for the security and safety of the money of users. The transactions are also fast since there are a lot of users that uses their flatform."

aS"Bittrex is really a good site for trading our tokens but since they are very strict to put up new coins on it then there are only a few choices for us to pick and another thing is that they're fees for every transaction is high compared to other exchange site out there especially when it comes to Withdrawing our tokens or coins. Anyway, I currently get used to on one exchange site for now which is HitBTC. HitBTC is by far the first site I've seen that has a lower fee than other sites and every deposit and withdrawal doesn't takes up a lot of time and most of it only takes less than 10minutes. So yeah for me this is my current favorite exchange site. This is just my Opinion."

aS'Binance for sure. Great customer service, constantly adding new coins & upgrading the platform, listen to their customers, pay Gas for Neo holders, low fees etc etc. I also quite like Bittrex. Had some bad experiences with Polo though, had a support ticket that took over 70 days of constantly following up to even get a reply from their customer service team :/'
p341
aS'for me it would be bittrex because it is easy to use and has many selection of altcoins for day trading which is nice for people who needs more money rather than focusing on 1 coin for the whole day.'
p342
aS'I also like bittrex although transaction fees are more expensive than poloniex, an elegant look that discards all unnecessary features like chatting. bittrex has a good level of security and is not often problematic. In addition I am also happy with the etherdelta, but these days are in trouble and seem to want to raise the level of gas they use.'

p349
aS'i prefer to trade in bittrex for my long term coinsbut i prefer to trade in cryptopia or coinexchange for short trades and its more comfortable using laptop than in my cellphone'
p350

aS'i am trading in poloniex and bittrex and i prefer with those sites because in poloniex, we can choose many potential coins and we can make profit too if we select the right coin. in bittrex, we can see there is many coins that sometimes having increasing so if we can follow the coins trade, we can make big profit.i am trade with my pc but sometimes if i am mobile, i use my smartphone also to trade and place my order buy and sell. but when i use my smartphone, sometime my signal is not good so i missed the time to buy and sell, but its no problem.'
p2
aS'My choice of exchange would be bittrex. I had been using Poloniex at the beginning but since it started giving issues to \xc2\xa0its users made me jump over to bittrex.Bittrex is quite user friendly and everything you need is just right there in front of you. It also has a variety of coins to trade and three markets for exchanging.I use my laptop for trading most of the times but when i am outside and if my laptop is not available then i manage it with my smartphone.Bittrex is accessible via phones too and it gives the same interface to you as on desktop site.'

aS'Since there is a lot of new coins in bittrex and they seem that they are all active. I choose bitrrex over all of the other trading exchange because i am comfortable with the security of bittrex and also their simplicity and easy to use controls and in their chart, i can use different tools or draw some lines for more efficient and effective technical analysis which i really like.'
p4
aS"Definitely bittrex, however not by a far margin.This is due to the fact that the amount of complaints regarding bittrex seems to be increasing. I do not know for sure whether it's just because poloniex lost a lot of their customers due to the fact that trollbox got shut down and whatnot leading to bittrex having to handle way more customers than it's used to, or it's just bittrex slacking off. Either way, it's their fault.Exchanges are getting stricter and stricter regarding KYC, which is a real pain in the ass. I use shapeshift for my day to day altcoin transactions now, it's worth the premium."
p5
aS"I love bittrex and poloniex but right now I use bittrex in exchange since I have no more btc in my poloniex account. What I love in bittrex because it has a low deposit in terms of bitcoin amount. The only thing I do not like in the other exchange site poloniex is that it has low fee if you will withdraw your bitcoins what I do not like poloniex is that it has high amount if you will deposit in there site so if you have only small amount of bitcoins or alts to be trade you can't trade to poloniex but all in all I love this exchange site both."
p6
aS'That is good questions, my favorite trading exchange is Kraken due to Kraken is reliable, there are no scam coins to be traded on there, so i can be more focus trading altcoins on there with no much the altcoins, the other reason i choose Kraken due to it support for smartphone,It makes easy to trading altcoins on there can be saw on every where.'

aS"Bittrex, bro. It's easy to use, comfortable for beginner"
p8
aS'I traded on bitcoin.co.id , poloniex, bittrex and sometime on quoine.com i prefer this exchangers not all of them but just poloniex and bittrex for trading altcoins because they are big markets on altcoins trading fluctuating of price is very huge getting profit from there are easy and bitcoin.co.id is just for Indonesian people, it is local market, i always use smartphone to traded bitcoins and altcoins.'

aS'My favorite exchanger are Bittrex and poloniex because most of the coins are listed in both exchange company. I analyze my trade with the use of pc particularly the technical analysis aspects of trading so that I will be able to view the candle stick movement well before placing trade .And I equally check my position on my smart phone whether am making profit or not.'
p10
aS"Yeah this is true. Bittrex is a friendly user to all like its not that complicated to trade.Plus, this is a major exchange so mostly of the coins are listed here. Also a lot of traders are using this so its easy to place an order. I've been using this since I started trading and so far I'm good with it.

aS"I always liked Poloniex's trading environment, but because of their shaky status in the past year I have also moved to Bittrex as my main exchange. For fun activities, I enjoy Cryptopia and the Waves Dex."
p12
aS'several years ago i was so often trade at poloniex because this exchange provide good feature such as low fees and plenty market support but since there is several unresolved issue regarding withdrawal and deposit account for some people so i decide to leave them and bittrex is my second options and currently besides my local exchange bittrex always be my main option for altcoin trading'
p13
aS'My favorite crypto exchange is Bittrex. I also trade in Poloniex and Etherdelta and Liqui.io .. I do not put my bitcoin in a single trading site. As wise people said, do not put all your egg in a single basket.'
p14
aS'Poloneix and Bittrex\xc2\xa0 Buying orders are high in these exchanges as compared to other exchanges like liqui, yobit etc.'
p15
aS'I highly recommend people to use bittrex because it is the best trading website. They support their customers very good. not like poloniex, their activities are very shady. Do not use poloniex because you might lose your money there. Many of my firends have suffered huge loss in this exchange '
p16
aS'My favorite trading exchange is BITTREX, for altcoins trading and investment, I have tried poloniex, but it is a bit slow. I will use both laptop and mobile for trading.'
p17
aS"I have actually used several exchange sites while some of the big names I am yet to experience the one that I liked most is C-CEX and the reason is because the way they handle tickets , it's something I love and the withdrawal is instant the moment you follow through with the instructions while they are equally on ground to provide response in case of any difficulty."
p18
aS'Many people here are suggesting Bittrex for everyone especially the newcomers. I just used this and seriously saying it is really good to use it. It is so user friendly. Everything is just being explained and displayed to you as long as you know the bits and cubs of trading. So highly recommended.'
p19
aS'I trade with different exchanges site . I CHOOSE BITTREX I LIKE THE STYLE OF BITTREX EASY TO USE . YOU CAN UNDERSTAND EASILY JUST NOT LIKE OTHER THE FEATURESIS REALLY HARD TO UNDEDSTAND. Sometimes I use smart phone when I on a bed butsometimes I use laptop for trading because If I use laptop i can see all while the smart phone limited I can see and its very little text.'

S'Hi all,What is your favorite trading exchange ? Why do you prefer this exchange ?Do you trade only with your PC or do you use your smartphone also ?Thanks\xc2\xa0 '
p1
aS'Bittrex and Liqui dude I prefered Bittrex and Liqui , Why? because that exchange is a user friendly exchange especially for beginners.I use that both device.'
p2
aS"I prefer Bittrex and HitBTC there safer, I am afraid to enter poloniex. With some problems everyone has left it.I trade using PC and Smartphone. That's very helpful when we're outdoors."
p3
aS'Im once a trader of poloniex and when the issues have risen on some users i tend to change or jump into another which is on bittrex and etherdelta. I do trade on both place which i do have my own pc and i do have my mobile phone. I do make trades depending on where i am. If im busy a little i would normally trade on my phone which isnt really hard at all. I love the user interface of both exchange site.'
p4
aS'Almost everyone here will vote for Bittrex as it has all the top coins which has stable coins and very less coins faded away from it. Poloniex was good until we find problems with many things. I would suggest you to stay away from low level exchanges. '
p5
aS'Why is everyone hating Poloniex that much? I gotta admit - I like Bittrex better, but everyone who left Poloniex when it was down for a few days already came back. For a few days straight - Poloniex had more volume than Bittrex.Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/'
p6
aS"Bittrex is first on my exchange list because their have big volume on bitcoin and some altcoin.Poloniex second choice because their fee very low.Etherdelta third because of import account that didn't cause fee(No need to transfer)."
p7
aS"But on Bittrex, I think it's not possible to put a limit sell order and a stop loss order at the same. Is it true ?Do you use your personal smartphone or a dedicated phone ?I think it could be dangerous to use a personal phone. What do you think ?"
p8
aS"I prefer Bittrex and Poloniex. But if im going to choose between these two exchange. I would choose Bittrex because safe and i never encountered any bad experience about this exchange. It is smooth and fast. If im not mistaken, it is a decentralized exchange which means, it don't need any documents to prove your identity. I signed up to Bittrex and they are not asking for IDs. Im usually encountered many problems with Poloniex. Sometimes i lose a lot because of their system problems. Overcrowded, that's what i see the problem behind those failures. Anyway, Kraken and Liquiexchange is popular too."
p9
aS'always i used poloniex pc and smartphone '
p10
aS'Hi there, My favorite trading exchange platform is Bittrex which was first exchange I used before. next one is poloniex I like this 2 exchange because easy to understand and use and both have great support, never had problems with them'
p11
aS"Since i'm trading with altcoins i only use Bittrex. This because it has a really simple way to use it. And i never had any troubles with deposit or withdrawal. Definetly recommend it but i unfortunately have no other trading exchange to compare so far."
p12
aS"Well for me I like Localbitcoins because they have automated escrow for peer to peer trades and we can offer multiple payment options while buying as well as selling Bitcoins with fiat currencies. I don't use it much on my mobile but on a desktop, I do use it for the passive trading purpose."
p13
aS'My favorite exchange is Bittrex because they are open and transparent with their clients unlike many others.'
p14
aS'I also have the same trust with you against bittrex, so far bittrex has the best reputation as an altcoin exchange place.Since mid-2015 ago I started trading altcoin in bittrex until now i have never experienced any serious problem with my transaction'
p15
aS"Bittrex is legitimately the best cryptocurrency exchange I've ever used.Unlike Poloniex, I've had no deposit/withdrawal issues whatsoever and their customer support actually replies to user tickets."
p16
aS"Is Poloniex as bad as people say? I've only used Bittrex so far which I never had any problem with and I'm just wondering what could go wrong with an exchange."
p17
aS'Yes bittrex does not have a stop loss feature but it is one of the best exchanges to trade alt coins right now with polo having so much trouble while withdrawing and depositing the coins,using smart phone is a personal choice and i am not comfortable using it,just use my smart phone for 2fa purposes when it comes to trading. '
p18
aS'Bittrex is my first choice I also like poloniex but I like bittrex more because it makes new coins available for trade rather quickly than poloniex. I use both laptop and smartphone.'
p19
aS'I cannot say its favorite but what is use are Bittrex, Poloniex, Bitfinex and Nova Exchange.'

S'its easy to say that we can earn this much,but most of the time its only in our dream because talking about trading and setting a goal or specific amount of profit is too difficult to achieve.because even the experienced traders or those what we called expert in respective fielt in which trading fails in some coins.OP you should just try to gain what is enough for the day but not expecting it to happen that soon you being i newbie in daytrade(i assume) will only has a chance of gaining but still chance of losing is more than winnings '
p1
aS'It is pretty difficult if yo do not even know what the hell you are doing, and $40 is not a huge amount of money, anyone who has a considerable amount of money for trading can easily make more than $40.There were days in when i earned more than $2000 in a single day.'
p2
aS'to earn 40$ a day is pretty easy is you have atleast 500$ in your portfolio, hell one good trade can make you double that'
p3
aS'The goal is a good one but you should have it in mind that there is no fixed daily income in trading. Trading is not always a win win situation. Therefore getting $40 daily profit sometimes can be a difficult thing'
p4
aS'Yeah your right 40$ daily income is hard especially in trading he will need a big amount or he need many coins to buy then it will depends how the coin will pump to reach the 40$, it so difficult. So i agree that he will need more experience and skill on day trade.'
p5
a.(lp0
S'I want to earn 40$+ per day from trading.I am buy some coin but this con are now 50%dump so now i am decided to start short time trade and earn minimum 40$ per day.So please help and give me some direction about it.'
p1
aS'Setting a goal is great, but trying to achieve it is definitely difficult especially as a new trader. It\'s really hard to say "I want to earn 40$+ a day" since there are also going to be days that instead of earning $40, you lose $40. My best advice is to just simply be updated on the news, and learn how to control your emotions. Don\'t just throw out a tantrum if price crashes and sell immediately; you\'re going to need patience at this game.Trading is almost always a gamble. You win some, you lost some.'
p2
aS'Change your tactics, buying coins will benefit you well if you know how to choice the right coin and the right time to buy.Small hint that I can give you is buy during presale and grab the big bonuses and after x5 of its value sell it and buy again. You should do your work on how to find the best coin to buy, it is very easy to find out if you are online everyday and you know how to read and understand. Another tip, read the whitepaper, roadmap,team,capability of its platform,their marketing techniques and lastly read different type of reviews together with the review of our fellow members. Its a hard work right? So decide now whether to continue or stop already. Goodluck.'
p3
aS'If we keep mind to get $40 as exact income is so hard. Because no exact income in tading if we calculate in a day.Better you do calculation in a month trading andits easier.Why do you think short \xc2\xa0trading is better? Need experience skill to do day trade. So prefer long term is better.'
p4
aS'If you want to make 40$ a day you also need to have a\xc2\xa0 big capital to trade for a short time trading. Stay away with the pump and dump coins because you will just lose your money there in a long run. Go with the trusted coin\xc2\xa0 like bitcoin, eth, litecoin, or monero.'
p5
aS'I think as a trader we should not set a goal as such a specific number. It is difficult to calculate accurately in each order, you can not control the exact amount you earn or lose, or if it can be very time consuming.Moreover, I do not know how much your trade can beTo me, I set a target of 3-7% of daily trade capital'
p6
aS'Say right... '
p7
aS'Trusted coin other than that coin you can search in top 10 in coinmarketcap.Trading that trusted coin is good in long run then just pump and dump coin. And day trade need high qualified trader.'
p8
aS'Mate if you are willing to take the risk of losing not only a few percent of your money but all of it in one day, you could try trading as suggested.What if while you are trading, you see a sudden change, drop, manipulation and sell to cut your losses short just to see a rise after you sold? it happens To me every time but I have no weak hands.'
p9
aS'It is possible to lose or to gain lots money,But I dont think a fixed number can be made here in Crypto.It is just fun'
p10
aS'You are doing it all wrong, if you invested in a coin and it dumped 50% that means that you made a bad trade, do not blame it on the coin, first you need to improve yourself and your trading techniques and then you need to raise a decent amount of capital and try to earn smaller amounts of money everyday, becoming a profitable trader does not happen just because, it is a process, and it takes a lot of time, if you are not willing to put in the effort then forget about trading.'
p11
aS"How much capital do you have? Earning $40 could be easy or could be hard depending on what you have on hand. With 1 whole BTC i can imagine trading it's volatile state right now could make you some decent gains. So yeah, no specific coin, maybe bitcoin. But as the saying goes, you need money to make money."
p12
aS"Just sure you'll buy and sell a legit coins. Get a better profit when you trade many at once you could earn more. The many your tokens the many you could earn its just the technic of all traders. Its better to buy now than selling. All the price of altcoins are cheap just sell in a better time. "
p13
aS'People think that trading is a milking cow but in reality more people lose money in trading. It is not easy. You need to study and learn from experience. Getting advice from random people on what coins to buy will surely make you lose money. What you must di is to learn technical analysis and chart patterns. Have some discipline and dont be emotional on your trades. Create strategy on your trades. When you have done all this then you will earn your goal.'
p14
aS"I think trading is a really difficult thing to do, I, myself, don't do trading. It is a very risky thing to do, and I don't have the guts to start trading. Maybe there are things you should know and consider before trading. But as I have observed, there is much loss than gains that I have seen, why not find something you can do, and start investing your time there, you can also earn doing errands from people needing helps."
p15
aS'this is perfectly correct,trading is just like a gambling its not because we speculate that will happen,most of the traders who earn good has a bigger capital.and for you whos expecting a great earning must have same capital to achieve that $40 a day.or else you wont make it possible'
p16
aS"Exactly, do not set your goals, it will be difficult for you at the beginning. What if you don't meet your goal? Are you going to chase it same day? what if you lose because trading is risky as well. Don't put pressure on yourself. Just take what you can in a given day. And remember, you will not win everyday as well. There are days that you are going above your target, and most of the time you will be in a negative. A realistic target should be around 1-5% per day and if you go overboard, consider it a bonus. This is one of the newbie mistakes in trading, setting unrealistic goal and if they didn't met it, they call it quit. Also there is the factor of skill. If you are very skilled in this craft then you can profit good, but if you are just started to learn the craft you might as well consider some lost, but learn that be a learning experience for you. But as you go along your journey, made mistakes and learn from them, I'm sure that there will come a day that you will be a successful trader."
p17
aS'Maybe you can try to minimize your goal per day atleast, I also do short trades as long i earn profit from that trade im okay with that no pressures.'
p18
aS'trading or investing is sure to earn you so much for the day, but if you do not have the money you will not even earn on your daily trading but when trading is too big you will probably earn more than just your investment. In all investment or trading you can earn as much as your investment but it depends on what you decide on.'
p19
aS"I'm not sure you can get that number every day but you can hold it bitcoin it can also help you make the money you want every day."
p20
aS'i want help with you mate but only you can help to yourself if want to earn 40$ a day you need to work with your own goals and decision what is the best coins for you and learn it if have potential to pump within 24 hour strategy and monitoring the the best way to know the best coin you can buy for trade.'
p21
aS'Its hard to predict which one we should invest on. If you want short term goal sell your tokens right away with minimal profit but for long time goal i suggest holding popular coins is better.'
p22
aS'You should start join telegram groups that give signal. Just buy and sell in less that 5 minutes and you will be able to make some profits. ut you should study the market before to know what the coins want to do and where they are trading. And you need to reserch for historical prices too. You can find that on coinmarket.'
p23
aS"You are serious about that? Crypto coins have different volume behaviour per day. To achieve your goal you need dedication on that and yes it's mandatory to stay awake for 24 hours monitoring the price if you want that goal. Tiring to do right?Trading is not meant to give you earnings everyday, it's possible but all things must be favorable to you which is not always possible. Short trades doesn't always mean you have to trade within 24 hours. Trading require patience. Believe me, hassle run to achieve your daily target will just wreck your strategy alongside with your goals."

aS"40$ isn't a big amount, i can do it in 4 hours with the 1000$ capital by day-trading. The stragedy here is surfing."
p26
aS'lol seriously? $40 per day on a pos coin? thats totally impossible because 40$ per day is\xc2\xa0 too big just by holding a proof of stake coin passively . if its true , then all people should buy that pos coin and were all gonna end up being lazy without doing anything just to earn money. $40 per day is only possible if you have a lot of skills and talents to do a different kind of jobs daily. also if you have a high rank account like legendary member , you can earn as much as 40$ per day in a high paying \xc2\xa0signature campaigns though you cant get your salary on a daily basis.'
p27
aS"It takes a lot of $$$ if you want to earn 40$ per day,, let's try to set a goal like 1 to 2.5\xc2\xa0 percent daily profit then we need at least 4k to 10k of initial capital to roll the money fast but it needs a lot of skills and knowledge to achieve that goal especially if you engaging into active trading. It takes a lot of risk but for a safer side it is much better to hold your investment like 2 to 3 months but the profit is not that quite high as long as your investment is safe."
p28
aS'How much is your capital for investing? To make $40 per day in trading is something like you are taking up a challenge. Only people that are capable of investing bigger money can do this or if not with big capital, those people who bought at the earliest time of that coin before it pumped. Just choose a coin that has an active community like ETH, LTC.'
p29
aS'To get fixed montly profit from trading is difficult, and to earn profit from crypto market should be have some strategy and risk management. For more easy and more safe to get profit\xc2\xa0 is by hold for long term good fundamental coin like BTC by portfolio 80%, then other 20% for altcoin trading. Because price of Bitcoin trend up now for the better doing short altcoin\xc2\xa0 trading espeacially altcoin that paired with BTC and choose some altcoin that has good in fundamental like ETH, DASH, LTC, WAVES, POWR, POLL, etc. Its important to learn fundamental analysis and technical analysis for altcoin trading.'
p30
aS'That was great that you have a goal, but i think your goal is very difficult to achieved here in crypto currency 40$ PER DAY good luck mate, I think even in trading with huge capital cant do this daily profit, its hard to find stable income in this field of crypto because of the fluctuation of every value of coin. You can only get that in offline job but you need a managerial position for that kind of salary per day. Wow that was nice to here it from you, if you can do that can you share you strategies on how to earn 40$ in just 4 hours trading with small amount of investment.'
p31
aS'$40+ with today\'s price is 0.0042BTC, if we say you can make 10% profit on a daily basis then you will need to invest 0.042168BTC ($400) in trading (that is 10% + 2 times fee of 0.2% on each trade).first things to consider is if you are comfortable with investing $400 in trading and risk losing all of it in case the exchange you are using scams you?the second thing to consider is that can you really make 10% profit on a daily basis and in a week how many times you lose money? it is possible to make that much but the question is if "you" can do it or not. and the important part is making profit in total not every day, because you may lose a day and win the next 6 days of the week.finally the strategy:what I use whenever I want to make a short term profit in one day, is buying the altcoins that are getting pumped that day. this is a risky investment but it can potentially pay out good. you look at which coin is getting pumped that day, you can do some research about it if you want too. then buy it and when you reach your desired profit you dump it. in your case it can be 10% or wait longer if you see potential of higher rise.do it every day and you earn that much.'
p32
aS'Thanks for sharing this tips, but i think we need much higher capital to make it through because if only 400$ i think we need to take too much time to make income specially me i do not want to lose my money with a wrong trade in altcoin that is why even small profit its just 90% possible income i will bite that quickly.'
p33
aS'Cryptocurrencies trading is quite different from spot or forex trading where you can set up your TAKE PROFIT and STOP LOSS and make $40 daily with a reliable strategy, but cryptocurrencies trading often defies technical analysis used in forex trading due to their high volatility and momentum making them difficult to set a daily \xc2\xa0profit target the most appropriate way of trading them is to buy and hodl.'
p34
aS"In trade you can't set how much you wanna earn, because \xc2\xa0trading is a really difficult thing to do. Sometimes you can get more than you want and sometimes you can lose. if you want to trade you can find information about the coin you want to buy and when the right time to sell it."
p35
aS'Well, I would definitely go for masternode coins. If you choose wisely, you will hold a coin for longer time frame (speculating on its price increase) while receiving regular payments (masternode rewards). This approach can give you more than $40 per day.'
p36
aS'trading is always risky.sometimes you loss sometimes you earn.if you want to earn 40$ par day you should have good knowledge about it.you need to study and learn form experience and update on the news.'
p37
aS'To achieve this goal you will have to be very perfect while doing the trades. The day trade is best option for you. In this you can keep yourself engaged in few coins altogether and try to grab profits over period of 24 hours. It is always observable that any potential coin which is not stuck to top 5 on coinmarket cap will have the opportunity to rise in first and you can have some profits through it. However, this has to be done carefully and with keen attention on which coins you are preferably investing into. For those coins for whom you lost more than 50% profits can have it in the portfolio and do not sell them right now. Wait for the break even at least.'
p38
aS"You want to earn $40 per day from trading but this is not easy, it depend on a lot of element as how much money will you use to trading? If your capital is $100 even $500 but you want \xc2\xa0to earn $40 per day this is too difficult. As me, you should set goal profit is 2-5%/your total capital instead of set goal $40 per day, it's more realistic than. In your case, i guess you're a new trader, i think you should trading with little money to accumulated experience before if you don't want to be lost your money"
p39
aS'It would not be easy especially the way at present the market is behaving. Like if you invest in btc at present you can make 1000$ in a day just like the other day we had rally. But on the other hand ystd it fell close to 1500$ so you can even lose out a lot. And for altcoins if you get the right signals you can make some money.'
p40
aS"what are some altcoins y'all recommend?"
p41
aS'Idk why these topics get this much attention... its like people asking "which coin is gonna go x100 soon?" - sure you can suggest, but if there was a safe call on this, everybody would be in for it, and how would it be a safe x100 then? same with asking "how do i earn xx$ daily?" Sure this community will suggest trading or simply holding on to amount XX of btc or any other coin that will net you this profit in the long run. But we are in a speculative market and if youre new to this world - based on the question you ask you are - there is no safe and guaranteed way to earn 40$/day... Buying 1 BTC back in September wouldve net you this amount by now just by holding. So either get into trading by learning first and actually earn later on - or just put your money into a coin like bTC or ETH and wait for growth to come..The safest way to make 40$/day is working a job with a wage that guarantees you the desired amount, crypto cannot guarantee you profit - its just that if you believe in crypto - and the market growth over the last years has shown a lot of people do, common sense is put your money in there and you will have x times more in the years to come.'
p42
aS'If you want to earn daily $40 so you must to invest then you can earn daily $40 but one condition that is if you have a more money and if you know about crupto currency trading . If you know it then you can make a $40 in a day . '

aS"it's good that you have some goad but don't put pressure on urself , trading is like life it has up and down and there are some days u will loose some money but if can't tolerate loss u dont deserve to win "
p44
aS'Earning $ 40 a day is a viable figure. You can use bitcoin to trade with altcoin according to the wave of the candlestick chart. You need to analyze Bolingerband and support line very carefully. Knowing this you can completely earn as much as you desire.'
p45
aS'Why would you think that only trading can give you that much earning per day. You an always have other ways to do. And before getting so much greedy why you don\xc2\x92t go for signature camping and earn a rank for yourself. Then slowly you can earn upto 100-200 USD per week. That is still enough money and if you add up twitter, Facebook campaign then you can increase the earning even more. Just think about it, there are multiple way of earning money and this way you can lead to systematic earnings. Believe trading is not as easy as it might look and it takes lot of time to acquire the knowledge about it then implement it and have it worked out perfectly. Too many steps to be followed and then you can have some profits. I mean 40 USD per day seems too much but with my strategy up there which most of the people are following now a days can get you big money over the time.\xc2\xa0 '
p46
aS"Target is good for motivation but it will give pressure for your activity and mindset. As trader/ investor we only need to follow and accept what we get because real market has their own rules and we can't do anything about it. For beginner, just try to find your best strategy with little money you have, no need daily target. Enjoy the journey and keep learn to built your skill. Good luck to you."
p47
aS"It's depend which deposit for trade do you have. Because if you have 400$ or 4000$ its make different, trading it's all about percent. If you want make 3-5% a day it's not so hard but if it's 10-30% it will be harder. My advise you to trade only good coins ( top 10-15 coinmarketcap)and watch \xc2\xa0closely to news here \xc2\xa0http://coinmarketcal.com/Also you should \xc2\xa0learn technical analysis. "
p48
aS"In a third world country it is a very big amount. Through day job getting such an earning is simply a difficult task. Business people get it, but that too doesn't seems stable. With bitcoin it is possible, but the user himself needs to be highly experienced in trading. Very few will be that knowledged to predict and make trading moves for such an earning."
p49
aS'It is not an easy task. You should not over-emphasize the benefits every day. Determine goals for a long time, invest a large amount of money and wait.'
p50
aS"This means you are not an experienced trader, short term trading is too risky then long term trading and it will need more expertise that a new trader don't have. Don't expect that you will start earning this amount after a single night, it will take time if you continue to work hard and smartly. Try to focus on market and learn about it, soon you will able to choose the best coins from the market which will benefit you like you are expecting."
p51

p52
aS"Maybe you shouldn't set so fixed profit to yourself. This is not so easy to achieve, sometimes could be less sometimes more but if you don't achieve your goal you might get frustrated and give up. It's better to develope some strategy that will allow you to minimize the risk and make you optimum profit compared to investment no matter how big it is."
p53
aS'Why only $40? It is very small amount, or do you have small deposit? With mine I already get almost everyday much more by simply doing nothing, since most good coins increases in price.'
p54
aS"It's not hard to make on average $40 a day but the crypto markets are booming.\xc2\xa0 For the past couple weeks, you could have bought about $500 worth of anything and you would have averaged $40 or more per day.I personally don't bother trying to day trade.\xc2\xa0 No interest in it."
p55
aS'You can reach $40 profit by either investing high capital with a loss risk or if you want to invest less capital then you have to take high risk for the investment. There are some other ways too like offering multiple payment options to the buyers as well as sellers with a flexible timing and good reputations on the platforms like Localbitcoins, you can earn anywhere from 1% to 20% per day by that way.'
p56
aS"I think that is very big target to achieve. Im doing the trading since one year now but I'm really able to grab couple of hundred dollars per 3-4 days period. So that sound really difficult task to get achieved but lets think for a movement what we can do about it. If you have bigger investments then you can invest into multiple coins so that you can increase your stakes and earning potential in that way. Im sure that more the investment the more returns you will get. But also know that this will put you in bigger risk of loosing. "
p57
aS'I dont know how is your capital to risk into trading, but the biggest and easy way is to buy and sell bitcoin since price is fluctuating a lot along the day, all you need is to get in and spend sometime into it, if you have around 1000 dollars to risk well you will see those moment happen into maybe 10-30 minutes, always a opportunity coming, if you dont wanna to risk soo much go into top traded coins and see their history for a week and make a decision, split into more then one currencie will help you as well to cut the loss.'

p64
aS"The question is: How much do you have? Your budget size is very important. If you have more money to trade your returns can be higher without much effort (but the opposite can happen too...). I would trade with the main Crypto-Currencies, always checking ETH, LTC, DASH, BTC prices, when the opportunity appears (to buy cheap), take it, but keep in mind it's not a job, you won't work all day long and always finish the day with a safe X wage on your pocket."

You lost in trading cause you don't have much knowledge and skills or maybe you didn't catch the right time to buy and sell. I think the best option for you at the moment is joining some trading signal group or try to buy some trading bot like Gunbot. it worked for me so I've tripled my amount of BTC in just 2 or 3 days )"

p68
aS"I would like to suggest you to use bitcoin trading with fiat Because to trade with the altcoins is really a risky thing now because the price of the bitcoin much sensitive and unstable , so with big pump and dump we can't handle the investment loss/profit easily in the altcoins but if we have trading with the fiat then price will not impact over the fiat .Here you just needed to work with the stable bitcoin market and making investment in multiple coins to lower the risk of investment , but wait for the bitcoin price stability .Now you should take your mind set that you should not work in the single field , work in multiple field to make money like investment in ICOs and sites , signature campaign or advertisement like things , trading in every possible ways , faucet collection if you have time ."

I would suggest invest on all coins that is offered in poloniex so that you can sell them when they are on its peak. In that way you are guaranteed a sure profit.'
p72
aS'poloniex is a good market. but, we also need to pay attention to the price. if you buy all the coins at a high price, that will certainly make you lose, and you certainly can not earn $ 40 a day. well, all you have to do is be careful in trading, especially if you are targeting a high income.'
p73
aS"blow in my ears if I did really not understand what your point. what with buying all the coins in Poloniex will get a $40 profit every day? damn. Doesn't it require capital and very thick pockets? of course with a very deep risk"
p74
aS"It may tricky as impossible to earn profit everyday due to cryptocurrency prices are fluctuate.You can buy some potential coins such as litecoin waves, ethereum, zcash or bitcoin, you will earn profit like 3-10% depends on your capital and how long you can wait due to these coins price constantly increasing over time.Short term trading by rely on some altcoins will be harder due to market react instantly every few hours or vice versa.I don't recommend to trade shitcoins, some random coins without potential as you're going to lose, just trust the most famous coins in the market."
p75
aS'not easy to earn 40 $ + per day is not easy .. to be able to analyze the trade so that it can get it very deep experience ,, because when trading you find success ,, you must be ready with defeat that will surely come to you ,, because not every trade is always successful'

aS"Maybe if you have enough capital you can buy into some of the alts that generate dividends to have an income. If you just want to day trade it's going to be a gamble."
p77

p80
aS"Honestly, depending on how much you have already invested, it may be very hard to make that amount. Honestly, I'm not sure how much they're looked down upon in the trading community, but I think if you're trying to make a large amount like that, you might need to find some way to get into a group with whales when they share when they're going to pump/dump a coin. It's pretty immoral, so I don't suggest you do it, but I believe that may be the only way to do so if you have a small amount invested."
p81
aS"It's easy to make $ 40 a day, but you have to be a trader for a long time to do so because trading to make a profit is very difficult and the success rate is only 20%. I think if you want to do well then you have to go to trade school first"
p82
aS"You're right, because having a big amount of capital makes it more easily to achieve the op's goal to earn $40 a day but with just a small amount? It would really hard plus you can't be sure if you invested on the right altcoin"
p83
aS"For me its hard to find earns 40$ a day,even in the bounty campaign they fee you\xc2\xa0 only weekly and\xc2\xa0 we can get that payments in a week.maybe in trading investment you can get that 40$ a day but you must need a big capital or asset\xc2\xa0 before you can gain that your expected earn.other way's is to find a potential coins that give you a huge profit in trading."
p84
aS"It's very easy to make $40 in a day from the various sources and not only doing a trade. I've staking all of my neo coins. The decimal was around 10k neo and i got almost 4.5 gas for every day and for each gas the current price was $20. it will be good to doing some works. Just like you can become a signature designer or some thing another that makes interesting for some people that needs your service in here. "
p85
aS"That's good question, basically you can get $40 per day but you can not get $40 daily because depending on the trend of the price alternative coins, you can get active profit from trading but you must trade with the strategy daily trading and you must have much time for stay on the computers every days and the most important you must have planning of trading that get constant profit from trading based on your strategy and your time and you must have the rules of money management in trading activity."
p86
aS"It's very easy for you but it doesn't guarantee to other people. As you said, you have been staking your neo and get some passive income everyday ($90)."
p87
aS'I would start with a small goal like 5-10% gains on trades no matter what the $USD or currency of your choice value of it is, but rather the satoshis.say you want to earn 5% profit so when you buy in a dip multiply what the price you bought at times 1.05 and that is your selling point. now sell at this point and do not worry about making more or getting greedy let this profit compound throughout the day and at the end of the day you will be happy with where you are. =) do this every day and you will accumulate experience and a balance to get your goal of $40 / day =)good luck'
p88
aS"There are various ways to earn that money in one day. I think we've got the answer from the writing above. We should always do research and find out the latest Altcoin and Altcoin are popular. For that, we must know the development of the world of cryptocurrency from this forum as well as other online forums. We can also find out from the facebook group which is the most popular and most powerful discussion place today. Our friend above has revealed important and good points for us to ponder. We can indeed get $ 40 from trading or even more. But maybe we can not get it every day. That is a great saying because we know that trading is an erratic job and we can lose and profit at any time."
p89

p95
aS"I recently started trading with a very small amount of money (around $100), and I try to get a %1 profit every day. I don't use leverage, and I always use my entire trading bankroll. I usually trade on Gdax because you can trade without being charged any fees, if you are the market maker. Since I'm trading for only 1% daily profit, this is quite important for me. With my small stake I've been having no problem achieving my goals, but I don't know if I could do it with a bigger amount. I could probably ask for more than 1%, and I will probably test it next month. Of course that 1% daily is quite good, because it would mean a 30% increase (and this would be even more, since I'm always using my entire stake, so it has compound effects).What I do is quite safe, but it wouldn't offer you $40 a day, unless you used a huge stake. You will have to risk a lot more, or use a very big stake."
p96
aS"If you can provide $1000 budget, you can get $40 easily a day. This is only 4% profit when we think the total budget, and it's possible in altcoin trading. They're very volatile as you all know. "

aS"It will be easy if he have an regular costumer but if not then there's no guarantee at all that we can earn it everyday but if people would learn to trade some crypto's then 40$ a day would not be a problem by anyone but we should have some huge funds to have it since we might gonna lose on certain coins but we can bounce back on different ones so flexibility of our capital intended for trades is a must to earn huge on this.

But I suggest if you have extra money buy morr bitcoin and start buying altcoin."
p106
aS"Patience is the key to this. You can say that you want to earn 40$ a day, but you gotta be prepared mentally for a commitment like that.

aS"It's good that you have a target amount in your mind when trading but don't focus too much in it at first because you will only be pressured to reach that amount in which case you may end up at a loss because when you see a coin going down, you might cut your loss immediately and transfer to a coin that is already hype and then upon buying, the price dump and you see the coin you bought before to be going up now so instead of you having profits, you end up losing. It happened a lot to me before because I am focus on having profits but do not have a consistent strategy. Be consistent first in your strategy and do not join the hype or FOMO. Consistency is the key to become a profitable trader."

As for me, as long as I'm on the + plus, I wouldn't mind it. 40$ is a big target to begin with, so I suggest that you should be targeting like 5-10% as starters and then gradually increase your target as you go along in trading.The key here is how to spot a coin that has a potential for you to earn a decent returns daily if you are doing short day trading. I'm sure you can found it, the problem is just how to spot it and join the ride."

p115
aS'While I agree with this, it is okay to have a daily goal as long as you do not expect to achieve it each day. Consider your returns over a week or a month and then divide them by 7 or 30 and get your daily return.

aS"Very well said which is actually true that we should not really force ourselves to set out an specific goal that we should achieve specially on daily basis.

aS'I think this is the right way to think about trading, when you are trading you should not look to make a particular amount of money, what you need to concentrate yourself is to make good trades, people concentrate too much on the amount of money they can make and that is a mistake, concentrate on becoming a good trader and the money will eventually come.'
p155
aS'You must be smart to see the conditions and you should also be able to analyze well. If you look at the current situation then I advise you to trade bitcoin, we already see that bitcoin has a high rate of increase so we can take advantage of the momentum that exists. That way we can benefit, most importantly we can be patient and never do action like panic sell. We all believe that bitcoin prices will continue to increase. This is our chance to take advantage of all the appropriate conditions. Do not ever worry if you have experienced a loss, it is an experience that can train you to make decisions later.'

aS'I think with trading he can earn $40 per day but he needs to stay focus on trading. at least he needs to spend 3-4 hours to just trading and it is better if he has a budget to start. besides to stay focus, he needs to learn more about trading so his chances to earn $40 its not too difficult. he can start to trade altcoin or fiat and its depend on what the research.'
p157
aS"With trading its possible to earn $40 per day as mentioned by several users. With bitcoin the risk is big, because we don't know when things gonna change. Another thing important is the trading asset we have in the trading account. If the assets we've is declining in the market we don't get the opportunity to get $40. So, several factors altogether stand to get $40 per day. This is not possible with every user."
p158
aS'trading doesnt guaranteed you that you can earn fix daily income because market is unstable.\xc2\xa0 if you want a fix daily income like the ones you mentioned then i suggest find another job like signature campaigns or other free lancing jobs because they might pay higher more than trading can give you. $40 per day is really possible to achieve if your a skillfull person and grabs any oppurtunities that might cross your way. you can check out marketplace>services section to find a job and mini task that will help you jump start your journey.'

aS"A big check! We always have a goal in everything we do but since OP wants to do a short trade it's hard to expect a specific amount to get since not all our book orders aren't sold within a day and sometimes day trading end up to swing trading. Maybe OP should just aim to have at least profited but don't expect a specific amount and we all knew how the crypto world runs so better not to worry."
p160
aS"For me as of now, i dont know how to earn that big amount. Im just new to bitcoin and also i dont have any funds yet to go into trading. Aside from that im still studying how the trading works. Theres so many aspect for that, also i heard that pump and dump of cryptocurrency can be manipulated by some or group of people. Maybe its possible if you have proper sources and teammates who shares information to possible pumps and dumps of altcoins. I think setting a 40profit per day is good but too risky. I think its the same thing if you're not going to get a profit of $40 this day but you will get $80 by tomorrow. So its safer to trade when the right moment comes!"

p162
aS'Trading is best way to earn more money but i want to start a small money like as 40$.Do u understand what i am say??  '
p163
aS'Aim for small swings that the majority of coins have. Search for coins that have a wide spread. Buy at the low end of the spread and wait for the jump to the high end. It typically needs just a small amount of money to be bought or sold to move sometimes even 10% up or down. By doing it wisely, you can make $40 per day.'
p164
aS'So if you are planning to have an initial investment or bankroll of $40 then you would really need to have 100% gain on daily basis since you do mention that you would need to earn $40 on daily basis which i would say it would really be hard.Yes,indeed trading is the best way to earn money but seeing on your bankroll it would really be hard to extent your trade orders which would really limit to make such one. Hedging and scalping would do but attaining 100% on single day wont really be a guarantee.'
p165
aS'If you want to earn 40 $ per day, you have to invest with a good coin, so if the coin is priced down it will not be too far down and you should continue to monitor the price of all the coins you have.'
p166
aS'I will tell you only that in trading to pursue a goal, this is a bad practice, you start to adjust yourself to some figures and frames, and the market does not see such limits and figures and can be spilled.'
p167
aS"think that earning exactly 40$ every day is very difficult. There's probably another mathematics here. In the month of 30 days. That is 30 multiplied by 40$ is 1200$.That is, to have an average of 40$ a day you need to earn a month 1200$. Now you need to rely on experience and strategy to estimate how aggressively we need to trade. I know that lot of people make 5% a day and consider it a good profit and with safe trade about 10% of the depot. That is, to trade with a small risk you need 5% * 30 = 150%That is, at 10% of the deposit it is 15% per month. To earn 1200 in this scenario, we need (1200/15*100) approximately 8000$ when buying a coin 10% from deposit. If you buy at 20%, then 150/5 = 30% per month. To earn 1200 in this scenario, we need (1200/30*100) approximately 4000$ when buying a coin 20% from deposit. Also this calculation does not include the daily growth of the deposit"
p168
aS'perfect, wecwill not be sure that we will get the profit for the investment we are making in the trading site. Investment fund should be increased cand splitter among the multiple currencies means you may expect that but still we will not sure that profit will returned to you end of the day.Hold the fund in the different currencies which has the potential in future.'
p169
aS'If you have $4000 than put it in multiple exchange platforms like $1k in one exchange with enough liquidity + trading volume so that you can quickly buy and sell large amounts. Now buy coin with high trading volume with pretty much stable chart, wait for some dump to quickly buy some and than sell it when it will return back to its constant price range. If you can sell it at even 1% higher price than your buying point than you will make your $40 that day. More than 3% or even 5% small swings is normal with almost all coins which lies under top 10 marketcap. '
p170
aS'Not all traders end with profit honestly some even practically sell on lower price to cut-loss due to some factors that affect the coin they buy before and have no chance to recover.'
p171
aS'I think in trading we can not make a target for profit every month. because trading is in my opinion unpredictable. maybe our target is 40 $ per day but it could be more than that and maybe even one day we do not get any profit at all in few days. so just enjoy your trading.'

aS'There are many ways to earn 40 dollars a day. But to earn it from trading, I think you need to have the potential market observation experience. Instead of investing in BTC, I recommend you refer to the ICO coins, it will help you increase 10 times the profit when investing in it. In order to earn a profit from trading, you have to be aware of the increase and decrease of the indicators, from which to observe and choose the potential coins for investment.\xc2\xa0 '

p176
aS"Lots of people quit their real life job for a full time trader job , and that is in my opinion just bullshit , since trading really needs huge amounts of money as kick starter to be able to make those +40$ per day , and having a real job is an important asset since there's lots of things in real life that imposes having one (such as renting a house , getting a loan or getting insurance ) , all of them will be backed by your salary that comes from your IRL job , and bitcoin ain't a salary ! "
p177
aS'we can earn $40 per day in trading but there is any requirement that we should have before we start. for example, we need to have at least $100-$500 to start, we need to have the skill to analyze every coin, we need to know when the time to enter the market, we need to have any info about the coin at least we can analyze the movement of the coin in the market.

p182

p185
aS"I'm not aware of these coins but yeah if they have a large fluctuation then you can try some of it because in day trading we need a coin that's have a high volatility for us to profit daily.

I wish you good luck. "
p189

You may be spend more time taking general research and learning deeply knowledge which connect to your coin investment. Especially, to gain 40$ a day, it depends on what coin you choose and how your capital are. If you are a person who don\xc2\x92t have experiences, you should start with small quantity ,then you expend it. we all know that trading in digital currency is volatile.
